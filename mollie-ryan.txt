(So now that I've got my foot in the door…)

(... I'm gonna slam that door on your foot.)

(I played myself.)

(Oh screw it)

(Mollie would you go on a date with me? Honestly, it's okay if you don't want to)

(Wait really? I always kinda thought I bugged you.)

(Sorry after I sent that I kinda freaked out, put my phone in the drawer, and went out to the beach (in LA right now).

I really want know why you think that I thought you bugged me. Like from day one, I thought you were super clever and funny. Every time I hear you laugh, it kinda melts me a tiny bit inside. Really you're like the only person I know who gets all of my jokes)

(I'm willing to go on one but no strings attached. Historically I'm not good at these things but I'm willing to feel it out, I don't want things to end up weird between us. 
Was now really the time to stop checking your phone?
😂 so you just let me freak out for the last hour)

(Uh honestly I'd wager that I was freaking out more)

(Sheesh don't put the expectations that high, you're stressing me out. And I dunno, I guess I just always thought you felt like I was too pushy or something.)

(Haha okay. But what do you mean by "pushy"?)

(Ok maybe it was just me over analyzing my own actions, but I just really, really wanted you to like me and your general air of indifference was making it hard to read you.)

(Dammit I'm just super shy. When I really like someone I kinda just lock up (which is pretty evolutionarily stupid if you ask me). No kidding, there's been a couple of times where I just really wanted to hug you and never let go)

(Stop I'm melting Jesus)

(No not Jesus!)

(Buddhism will rise)

(Haha see I love this sense of humor and not many people do it as well as you)

(Fortunately I'm a product of successful evolution)

(😄)

(Ha)

(So, I have to ask, elaborate ruse or actual party?)

(Uh I tell you about it later but yeah I was with my cousins when I got pretty wasted for my first time)

(Cuz you know, your prefrontal cortex doesn't fully develop until you're at least 25, and I just can't imagine the valedictorian of our class threatening his assets for such a petty thrill.)

(Yeah I know 😕)

(What happens in LA stays in LA)

(Seriously I kinda went overboard and got drunk like 4 days in a row this past week)

(WHAT)

(How are you even able to hold a conversation?)

(Uh that was the first day)

(😂 and you only texted me on the last day?)

(Then I just felt really depressed and drank a bunch which made me feel happier
But I'm all good now!)

(Aw Ryan no)

(Yeah just please don't tell anyone right now)

(Don't worry about it)

(And honestly I don't think anyone would care, I just like to give people crap 😉)

(Yeah I just feel like me of all people tho...)

(We were trying to test this theory btw https://xkcd.com/323/
Okay I need to eat dinner now, so phone's gonna be off)

(Same. Haha I'm interested to hear the results)

(So what's the deal with the read receipts?)

(The read receipts?)

(Yeah)

(Oh you mean the notification on text?)

(Well if I were to hazard a guess I would say that you don't have them turned on?)

(I'm pretty sure they're off by default, I'm just curious of why you have them on)

(Not that big of a deal. I'm just curious)

(Wait you can tell I have mine on?)

(￼)

(I don't even know, I assumed they were on by default
Hm. I guess I like people to know when I'm ignoring them on purpose 💁😂)

(Yeah it just tells me that you read my text, that's all)

(What now?)

(Dammit Mollie)

(Uh idk. I'm just glad you didn't say no)

(To the initial question?)

(Oh yeah and it totally works too)

(😂 I'm glad you and your cousins decided to test that theory)

(Once I got the hang of it, I downed two shots of whiskey and programmed from like midnight to 5am and earned $300 on a job which is crazy)

(I could tell from your eloquent dm that night)

(Moving on to the hard stuff 😉)

(Wait what?!
What happened to the Chinese tea Ryan? 😂)

(But not anymore because I'm really scared of the permanent brain damage)

(The hard stuff will get rid of that fear real quick)

(Yeah...)

(As you've already demonstrated 😂)

(Seriously alcohol is really scary. Like you lose all inhibitions
Which is good for creative things like writing or coding I guess)

(Haha sounds like I could use some. Then maybe my damn robot would work)

(It would be really funny to see drunk Mollie haha)

(Then I'd finally start living up to my name 😂)

(Haha I think narcotics might one be step too far)

(Anyways I need to wake up at 5:30 tomorrow)

(Go big or go home 🤘'night)

(Hey are you free tomorrow?)

(Ryan tomorrow's Easter)

(This year I'm only doing one of those I guess)

(Dont you have to cook a ham and fight with your siblings?)

(I totally forgot about Easter, I guess we cancelled it because of LA)

(Yeah, I'm spending my Easter on a 6 am flight to Boston.)

(College stuff?)

(But at least I don't have to sit through another ham dinner 😂)

(No I just wanted to skip Easter.)

(😐)

(Now that Audrey's hit puberty the sibling rivalry is getting a little dangerous)

(Haha I think after high school I stopped fighting with my sisters because you realize it's not worth it
(aka you never win))

(Well maybe you don't 😏)

(Yup)

(Haha first child problems)

(So I was at UCLA today and they had a sports fair, and they had three rowing machines. I think they're called ergs or urgs, idk)

(Oh baby, ergs, probably the single most heinous torture machine mankind has managed to think up)

(Yeah I did it for one minute)

(That's my shit 😂)

(And I about died
That is not my sport at all 😂)

(Haha it about kills me every time 😂 weirdest sport ever)

(Aww 😊)

(It's ok, the want you for your dashing good looks and party instinct 😉)

(But I'm still gonna take you out on at least one date...
So give me a freaking day already)

(Hm looks like you'll have to wait until next Saturday, late afternoon/evening)

(I wouldn't doubt it, but damn that's so long. Oh well)

(I've been in high demand lately
Waiting will make you want it more)

(Damn Ryan's thirsty)

(Yeah or forgot about it... 😁)

(Am not
I'm so bored right now. We're gonna be driving home and switching drivers until 3 in the morning)

(That should be perfect for your screwed up sleep schedule)

(Oh you know it 👌)

(How's it hanging miss Mollie?)

(Glad to see the brain damage didn't wipe your memory 😏)

(I'm about to die)

(Unfortunately. Your trend of poor timing continues as my practice is now beginning.)

(One mile race eta 15 minutes
You can have my robot if I don't make it out alive)

(😂 can I have it anyway? Pretty sure mine is gonna snap in half as soon as I try to drive it)

(I just freaking PR'd 😄)

(I'm on top of the world. Nothing can take me down)

(I, on the other hand, just had to make up a weeks worth of erging 💁)

(Ugh erging sucks. I ran a 5:03, so next meet I'm definitely breaking 5:00... then I can quit track)

(Haha what'd you run?)

(Pro tip, if you get pneumonia you never have to run again)

(Got pneumonia and a sore throat)

(Then you can really focus on your rap career)

(I see several others, in the same boat
Sick as a dog,
And sick as a goat
Lungs swell up - they bloat
Ok I'm done)

(I think your primary issue is your rhyme scheme)

(I'm looking for a critic)

(The words are creative but you have a same-rhyme pattern throughout, you need an ab kinda method
I knew it
Kinda like you forgot any rhyme schemes above the second grade level
Ryan)

(*not
Whoops I forgot that word)

(That's the kind of heat the people want)

(Like you could do any better)

(Give me a topic)

(Spit that heat)

(Why on earth crew. Who do you roast
Crew already effs everyone up 😂)

(Ain't no feat
Crew
Go go go
Hey my phone's going to die soon. So if you want to do something tomorrow, let's plan it now)

(Aight)

(I doubt it)

(You're about to get a flaming verse boi
Just so you know. Whaddya like to do?
Wait for it
Your lungs are fire 
Arms weak, 
Body perspires you wanna give up and stop, but the team pulls on, 
Driving and catching to the rhythm of this song 

You cut me off so this is a work in progress
🔥🔥🔥
Rhyme scheme is everything)

(I'm just gonna call you because that's easier
Damn girl
I really think you need to be a writer though
You definitely have a way with words)

(My witty remarks and elegant prose fly over the head of all the normies 💁😂)

(That can only be obtained by reading obsessively as a child)

(What can I say. I was socially awkward
You inflated my ego
All that isolation had to give me something. 
I am the second coming 🙏)

(Well that was pretentious
Now bring it back down a notch
Jesus Christ
😐
Okay now)

(As was planned)

(Well that was effective)

(Mm hmm
Okay I need to go warm up now)

(You may bring a little of my heat to your race)

(I'm ready)

(🔥 here you go)

(Ready for everything with ol JC watching over you)

(Haha this is great. I love the actions in the asterisks and especially your multiethnic group of rapper friends 😂)

(You shake, legs falter but you know that you're strong, you know that you've got it, that push to push on, 

And you slide to the catch, and place that oar and you dream about every time you've dreamed of more and when the time comes to push, you drive with all your might, you're not backing down until you give this team a fair fight 
*c scale plays on a piano*
*mumbled remarks from your multiethnic group of rapper friends* 
*epic chest bump w Eminem and swagger off stage*

I'm just leaving this here)

(And guess what... I freaking PR'd again)

(😂 oh crap I forgot to take those out before I sent it)

(So where is your thing tomorrow?)

(Haha you're welcome 
well I'll be rowing till around 1ish at the sac state aquatic center but then I'll probably head home to clean up
What's your timing?)

(Well it's still the same 2-6pm that I'm free
But I'm debating whether or not to carpool with friends. They're all taking the same car, but that kinda limits my mobility
...unless you want to chauffeur me around)

(Hmmmm a bold move)

(Uh...)

(I guess I'll help you out
Where do I get you?)

(We don't really know yet)

(We?)

(So it's either at the intel campus in Folsom or oak ridge high school. But I'm not sure because they haven't sent out an email yet.)

(😂 what am getting you from?)

(Wow they like to make you wait almost as much as you like to make me wait)

(Honestly we don't have to go very far. Just find the closest coffee/ice cream shop and hang out for a bit)

(😐)

(Aight sounds good)

(You know you can text first right)

(I get nervous)

(Haha just don't do that)

(It's okay, I've been burned pretty bad before too)

(These ill rhymes hide minor insecurity)

(Uh... Maybe some other time)

(You? How?)

(Fair enough)

(Alright sounds good. I'm still going strong off of two hours of sleep haha)

(Anyway, just keep me updated tomorrow and we'll work it out
I need to go to bed)

(Goals)

(Yeah I think I kinda numbed myself with sleep deprivation)

(Still going strong off those PRs 😂)

(Anyways... goodnight
￼
Dammit 😕)

(Aw your little code thing got canceled?)

(Ugh I was really looking forward to it)

(Shouldn't you be able to hack anytime you want? 😏😂)

(￼)

(So how does this affect the day?
And more importantly, my gas situation 😂)

(I was looking forward to the midnight yoga
Yeah less gas for you. That means we can stay local)

(I am inherently suspicious of anyone who spells ceremony wrong)

(Oh shoot. I'm really impressed that you can catch that)

(Haha aight what do you wanna do?)

(I don't know yet. I was just about to take a shower then I got that email. I'll let you know in a little bit, unless you have any ideas)

(This mind is like a steel trap)

(Yeah okay)

(Ok just keep me updated. I'll probably be busy until like 2-3ish)

(Newcastle Produce at 5:00? And bring walking shoes 😉)

(You want me to walk after racing 2000 meters? I must be excited to agree 😂)

(You can always limp haha)

(😂 I limp anyways)

(Watch this:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mlYkIJVguCU)

(Is this considered a show?)

(Yeah they had a TV show for two seasons)

(Haha that's actually really good, I think ive heard these guys before)

(Ryan this is that indie streak I told you about…)

(I was tricked into going to Jake's house tonight)

(I'm not a hipster)

(See now that's what all the hipsters are saying)

(Eff me)

(Because being a hipster is too mainstream
Haha how did you get tricked into going to jakes house? 
I think it's a little soon…
He did?!
HAHAHA
Aw he wanted to see you
Cute)

(Right after our thing, he texted me that he bought a Nintendo switch
He lied to me
Yeah so that's what I'm doing now. Smashing with my buds)

(*non-sexually so far)

(Non-sexually)

(They wanted you for something 
That's what I get invited to things for)

(Diversity quota probably)

(For example, college 😂)

(But you're white af...)

(Obviously someone hasn't been to Boston 
😂 in college I'm the minority)

(Wait what's the majority?)

(You…)

(Half-Asian half-Caucasian 5'10"-ish males)

(And maybe some Indians but it's close
Didn't you technically just admit to it?…
😏)

(Who are self-denying indie fans
Frick
I'm done)

(I might not start the texts but I certainly finish them 🔥)

(Sorry if I'm being sporadic. I'm just in the middle of getting my ass kicked)

(Why am I like this)

(Yeah by me)

(Oh I will 😉)

(Haha it's all good. I gotta eat anyways. Have fun smashing)

(Hey Mollie, would you do me a favor and read this?
http://shadows.surge.sh/)

(You got it)

(Haha I wrote it)

(Woah where did you find this?
It's super good I like this a lot
Haha what a hipster thing 😂
Really?!
REALLY
Ryan that's amazing!)

(Yeah idk I like writing)

(It kinda melted my heart a little. Like I felt butterflies when I read it because I could identify with it)

(Yeah... That's pretty much how I feel too)

(It was exciting)

(Like you didn't already have enough talents)

(Just wanted to put that out there)

(What a renaissance man 
You god?
*good)

(Haha thanks
Yeah
I'm just so fucking scared of getting hurt, so please be gentle you know?)

(I will be, I get it. I don't know what happened to you but I really like you Ryan and I have only the best intentions I swear.)

(Alright thanks)

(If you want to talk I'm here)

(So second date?)

(I hope)

(😊 yes)

(I'd love that
I keep rereading this and getting butterflies and it's not even mine haha
Maybe you should be the writer
So when do you propose this date?)

(Maybe I'll send you some other short stories I wrote sometime
Uh idk probably this weekend or Friday. I'm booked every other day)

(Me too)

(Alright sweet)

(Weekend
It's ok 😂 I'm not great at it either but whatever we'll work on it
You can help me build my stupid robot 😂)

(And I'll try not to be so shy in class)

(Really?)

(Haha I'm only good at the software and wiring. I hate working with Legos...)

(Why STEM?
I mean I'm kinda doing the same thing but why exactly?)

(But yeah, I think if I wasn't so pressured into STEM, I would have been an English major)

(Same)

(Well first of all, mom and dad say jobs are easier to get / pay more / etc.)

(Now you've got a swollen head because I accidentally called you god earlier
Great)

(And secondly, I'm pretty damn awesome at computer stuff
Pretty sure it wasn't an accident
Freudian slip)

(Dammit 😂)

(Haha thanks)

(But you can always double major or something right?
Because you seem like you've got some real talent, or at least passion 
That's hard to find)

(Yeah I'll look into that
I should probably go back to studying for my chem test though)

(I should probably study for calc. But seriously thanks for sharing with me, I didn't realize there was this side to you)

(There are so many facets to me...)

(Haha nights like these I wish I only needed two hours of sleep)

(Yeah that's what I do all night sometimes
Just write and write and write
And then delete it all for the hell of it)

(Send some my way next time, sounds like some of it deserves to be heard 😏)

('night)

(Goodnight)

(Be gentle okay?￼)

(Ryan Jacobs you absolutely melt my heart)

(Yeah I think you pretty much nailed it. It's a safe and elegant way to say something really meaningful without going completely out there)

(Of course I will
You've really got a thing with metaphors don't you?
I get it. They're clean and easy to understand. You get to gloss over the painful and messy and confusing things and extract only the purest part of what you're trying to impress upon your audience. You know only people smart enough to understand them and hopefully then understand you will recognize the metaphor, but the people who don't see it can't make fun of your work. 
Sorry if I took that one too deep, it's been awhile since I've gotten to just ramble I guess.)

(That one was probably the sappiest thing I've written. But I meant it. And I hope you liked it
I bet your heart smoothie tastes like cherry or something)

(Now that's one for the quote book 😂)

(Mm hmm)

(Ugh you make me feel like I should try to be a better person and start writing again Ryan)

(Mollie I really think you have a talent for words. Takes one to know one haha?)

(Like I can just feel it. And I know that you'd be a good writer
I can tell you pretty confidently that 99% of high school writing feels contrived. Like a bunch of 18 year olds shoving their vocabulary down your throat, trying to make it work when it doesn't)

(That's actually why I initially stopped. The fear of becoming that stereotype starts to overcome the desire to speak your heart. When I was younger kids always made fun of the way I talked because our vocabularies were so vastly different, and I guess after that my desire to write for myself just tapered off.)

(Haha wow that was deep. When you read *that* much as a kid it really changes how you think and play with words. You should probably start writing again...)

(Woah you're making me look too deep into myself Ryan 😂)

(Mmmmm someone wants a short story in return)

(Wait what?)

(Haha we'll see
Dammit my inherent desire to belong is really bothering me now)

(Which part?)

(I can't tell if you mean belonging to non-writers or writers.)

(It's all messy)

(Belonging in society. When I was younger I was the only one who liked reading, I looked different, talked different, had different interests, etc so I consciously changed myself to fit in better)

(Mom's spaghetti)

(I just mean human beings drive to feel like they have a place
See now I've got word vomit)

(Aww you shouldn't have to change that much)

(Nothing should or shouldn't happen. It just does)

(That's what makes a person special. Like all the greatest people in the world are great because they're different and they're okay with that)

(Also what if we wrote a short story, trading off every other sentence?)

(I know that now and that's why I'm so bothered by it.)

(Haha that's so funny)

(Ooh
I'm interested
And nervous
😂 Stephan and I wrote a book together in seventh grade)

(I need to read that
What was it about?)

(Oh no)

(Oh yes)

(Haha he wanted it to be like the city of ember and I wanted it to focus more on the issues in the protagonists life and general worldview)

(Oh dang I remember city of ember)

(Needless to say it starred two perfect best friends up against the world
💁💁)

(It was pretty spicy)

(Haha yeah I don't think I'm very good with sci-fi, never tried before)

(But we were in very different places obviously 😂)

(I like things to be too scientifically correct 😂)

(And dialogue has always been tricky for me. I always kind of spam whatever I'm thinking and echo it through the characters)

(Me too)

(Ugh I hate outlines)

(It's hard to keep one character "in character" they all just end up sounding like my thoughts 
I recommend making outlines for each though)

(Also I just found out about those things
They're so much fun)

(Wait how do you do that?!)

(Idk I just got my new phone working)

(It's the little icon with the heart and two fingers)

(😂 and what were you trying to write ?)

(Mmm cursive)

(Mmm cursive. The sexy, cultured cousin of shorthand)

(Always gotta put me down 😐)

(Though it kinda looks like you missed fourth grade calligraphy…)

(Well I also need to eat soon. Hopefully food this time)

(You're so high it doesn't even matter 😂)

(Yeah that's a valid point)

(😏 not with me around)

(Yeah...)

(Wait that sounds kinda weird 
I was referring to eating your words)

(😂)

(Oh gosh 😊)

(But tomorrow, I'm going to find you. And I don't care how nervous I am, I will give you the biggest bear hug until you can't breathe anymore)

(I'll hold you to that 😂 haha go eat your food)

(Oh yeah and I did listen to Tommy)

(And while you're at it, listen to Tiny Glowing Screens pt 2 by Watsky)

(It's a little weird, kinda like slam poetry but I think you might like it. He's got rhyme scheme figures out)

(Yeah I didn't realize that pinball wizard was about tommy)

(Hell yeah 
Move on to Rush and Styc
*Styx
Or Police)

(Damn I've got so many)

(Yes yes yes)

(It's great right?!)

(Now we need to talk music at some point)

(God I love it)

(Okay really need to go now)

(Progressive rock is one of the most underrated genres out there)

(Haha yeah prog rock and all of the fantasy themes)

(Ok ok
But that one song)

(Talking heads too)

(I'm liking what you're saying)

(Holy shit Mollie texted first for once)

(You need to listen to Talking to Myself by Watsky too)

(And yeah I'll listen to both of those)

(Secret confession: I actually meant to text you first all of today but you're sappy writing beat me to it)

(Frick well at least we're on the same wavelength or whatever)

(Aw)

(Way to kill the mood)

(It's like girls syncing up their periods
So sweet)

(Nothing makes you feel closer to someone than sharing the pain of menstruation)

(Ew no)

(That's one for the quote book)

(And where is this quote book you speak of?
Also can I at least know what you thought about sending?)

(That's for me to know)

(A music recommendation?)

(Haha I sent what I wanted to)

(Gosh that's touching)

(Omg just listen to it)

(Okay okay)

(Music is a big part of someone)

(Who?
jk)

(You cant take that back 😂)

(Holy crap thanks for introducing Watsky to me. Talking To Myself really hit me hard)

(Right?!)

(Yeah definitely. Oh gosh all of it)

(RIGHT?!!!!)

(Oh gosh)

(Okay checkout Courtney Barnett if you haven't yet
- elevator operator
- sleepless in New York
- avant gardener)

(Lyrical genius
You're welcome)

(Just pick one
Same kind of rambling lyrics
But with more guitar stuff)

(Guitar stuff is my shit)

(I really like sleepless in NY)

(On it)

(How bad is it to identify with this stuff?)

(Okay a little bit)

(Haha Ryan this is so hipster)

(Uh idk. Just being human I guess)

(Being human is so weirdly awful and wonderful)

(Haha yeah)

(I really like how her singing kinda echoes thought process, good find)

(And I like how it's still upbeat despite the subject matter)

(I think that's what makes it relatable almost)

(Okay I'll give it a go)

(It's kind of a realistic take on how people view some of the darker aspects of life
Ok one more. The Grand Illusion by Styx
It's just a really good song
Then I'm done for now)

(Also whenever I hear "Styx" I think of you, which is kinda funny
It's because for three months Kyle and I had that tune stuck in our head and we had no idea what it was from. And then you told us haha)

(I know my music)

(Well that was a nice song)

(Haha that's the best thing I think anyone's ever related to me)

(I don't know if I buy it completely though. I think if you go really, really deep we're probably all the same with the same insecurities and fears
But then there's definitely a lot of issues that are specific to certain people with certain belief sets
Just my two cents
￼Also this isn't a good sign when YouTube recommends this)

(Omg it's just a good tune chill out 😂)

(Yeah it sounds great though 😄)

(HAHAHA
I totally called it)

(I called it a solid week ago)

(Dammit how would I not know this)

(I'm still in denial. I really don't think I am)

(That's exactly how I knew)

(Ugh I want to argue back)

(A true hipster rejects all formal labels)

(But I can't 😐)

(Exactly)

(That's so much)

(Haha ok goodnight
I need my 9.5 hours)

(Okay goodnight)

(It's called beauty sleep)

(So what's your idea?)

(You should try it)

(Really? At the start of gov?)

(Oh whoops, I didn't expect you to respond that fast. I was driving)

(I feel like it might actually be dumb 😂)

(... and what's the idea)

(Don't text and drive!)

(Haha yeah that sounds like fun)

(Uhhh ok don't laugh. What about something like doing a geocache?
It seemed fun at ten last night)

(We found one on accident in the auburn canyon)

(Ok so that's just one idea that seemed like it might be conducive to conversation)

(Hmm yeah that sounds good to me. If I think of anything else, I'll let you know)

(Open to all suggestions though)

(I'm free all of tomorrow and most of Sunday)

(I'm a little touch and go rn)

(Uh I'm not sure yet. It's kind of flexible but I was going to do some stuff with other friends at some point)

(When are you not free Sunday?)

(Same)

(Alrighty)

(Aight just keep me in the loop)

(Okay I'm free on Sunday until 4:00. I've got two questions though: Have you ever been to Satan's Tunnel? And also what time do you normally go to bed? Because I tend to plan things at like 12 or 1 in the morning and I'm guessing you're probably asleep by then)

(Oh I've heard about that place!)

(Also I've always wanted to do one of these things:)

(Usually just a little before then on weekends but I have to be at the aquatic center at 6:30 so I went to bed early last night
Good idea)

(http://beattheroom.com
Dang how can you get up at 5:30?)

(Woah that looks awesome!)

(I don't even know what those words mean Mollie 😐)

(Freakin Kobe signed me up to stake boat hold 😩😂 but at least there's free food
It's not all bad as long as you don't get pulled into the lake)

(I wouldn't expect a normie to understand the deep and complex culture of crew)

(Hold up I found a tutorial on YouTube)

(Needless to say I'm an integral part of the racing process 💁😂)

(I'm about to become an expert)

(I expected nothing less 😂)

(Wait so you just hold the boat until it goes... And I'm pretty sure the guy in the video is doing a super man pose)

(Woah accidental rhyme)

(The super man pose is to remind the boat that we're their heroes)

(I really hope you get pulled in)

("Accidental")

(It's already happened to the lane next to me. At this point taking a swim is a real concern 😂)

(Mmm then all of them get the opportunity to jump in and save you)

(Nothing like sliding off the dock like a greased seal in front of a bunch of college boys 👌)

(Not only will you be drowning in water, but also drowning in college dudes)

(Lowkey think of one of them goes in I'd have to save them 😂)

(Ooh got 'em)

(For being such good colleges the apparent intelligence of their crew teams is quite disappointing 
USC could deny me admission but the can't figure out how to turn a boat smh 
Then again, I guess these guys are on athletic scholarships 😂)

(What other colleges are there? I didn't realize this thing was that big)

(Eh. Like Stanford and the UCs and the privates. Idk, I'd count all these particular boats as second string athletically)

(Haha that's why I'm here)

(People come to California to party, not to row)

(Parents left home and got married at a Vegas wedding
And now I'm here)

(Thank god for californication 🙏😂)

(￼Okay so here's the plan. Tell me what you think.

We'll carpool to auburn to checkout satan's tunnel, then we can mess around in downtown for a bit. There's a couple of geocaches nearby as well (green dots on the map))

(I also really want to do that escape room at some point, so if you're still down we can do that afterwards)

(Yeah sounds fun!)

(I meant literally afterwards. The thing is only an hour long and I don't know how much time we can possibly kill in auburn)

(And by afterwards do you mean as future date or literally after?
Also when do you want this to take place?)

(Um probably meet at 10:30 or something. I don't know if I can wake up much earlier 😂)

(You mean tomorrow?)

(Haha oh crap)

(Cuz we ended up planning a last minute practice at 1…)

(Tell me about it)

(Okay well I'm free after 3:00 today after I vandalize placer elementary with Conner Wilson)

(Placer?!)

(And tomorrow I might be free again)

(My old stomping grounds!)

(Was that your school?)

(Damn right it was my school)

(*placer)

(I ruled that place)

(Did Conner go there?)

(😂 I don't know where he came from)

(I'm not going to incriminate myself over text Mollie)

(What exactly are your intentions?)

(And tell me your schedule)

(I think it's a little late for that…)

(￼Okay tell me if you want to do the 5:45 slot or the 7:00 slot and then everything will be flexible around that. And don't worry about the cost, I'll pay this time)

(Ok. I think I'm outta here by 12:30isg and probably free after like 2. I'm supposed to meet up w Bree later but I can probably move some things around)

(You sure? You really don't have to that sometimes makes me feel bad)

(Haha you can pay if that makes you feel better. It's like $29)

(K let me check on some things real quick)

(Yeah don't worry about it. I got it)

(Alright cool. I appreciate that a lot actually)

(Just let me know what time slot)

(You got it. This is the 21 century haha. I'll know a time in the next few min)

(Yeah I'm gonna do 7pm. That gives me more time too)

(Whichever time you wanna do looks like it works w me
I would say 5:45 but if you still want to do satans tunnel and stuff then 7 might be better for you)

(So I'm gonna buy the tickets now)

(Ok I'll pay you back)

(So 5:15?)

(Sure)

(Oh I was going to pick you up or meet at a park and ride)

(To be clear, we're meeting in auburn?
At that spot?)

(Oh ok)

(Probably should have said that before)

(My address is 9662 cripple creek Ln 😂 park n ride is good too just let me know)

(Yeah, "Hey girl, just meet me in the red circle thing" would go over well)

(😂 you tried to be thorough. Respect)

(Okay your only like 8 minutes away from me. I'll just swing by at 5:15)

(K just let me know what you wanna do)

(If you have a flashlight I would bring it
Ugh *you're)

(Glad you caught that 😏)

(Alright it better be worth it or else I'm ditching you)

(Haha it's actually perfect that you're coming over because I have something awesome to show you)

(I promise you have never experienced anything like it)

(Sure sure. We'll see)

(Holy crap I think I know what it is haha)

(You don't)

(￼)

(Try)

(I'd recognize those thumbs anywhere)

(WHERE DID YOU GET THAT)

(Idk it was on Snapchat)

(NATALIE
THE SNAKE)

(I'm stoked though)

(I OPENED MY HOME TO HER)

(... But I just came out of the closet)

(ok ok. Sticking your head in the closet is still gonna be cool)

(…now it all makes sense)

(Screw off haha)

(😂)

(You did this to yourself haha)

(I know I know. You just had a set up that I couldn't pass on)

(That was the plan 😂)

(Always two steps ahead miss mollie)

(Obvi 💁 try to keep up)

(Sometimes it's better just to turn around completely)

(Just gonna throw out that vaguely inspirational sentence)

(Just hang on haha)

(Do I just come in?)

(The dogs will bark but they're cool. Pet Sam on your way in
He's the big lumpy one)

(Yeah I'm right up here)

(Oh dammit Mollie)

(Ok it was a love bite 
😂 that's what my dad called it when the cat bit me
Wait Kobe says that means hickey. 
I take that back
Nvm)

(I'm still in disbelief
Despite all of the awkwardness, that was amazing. I'm so freaking euphoric right now)

(Haha me too. 😂 sorry about the teeth, it was just a reaction)

(Yeah there was a bit of teeth 😂)

(I'll work on it)

(Any pointers for me haha?)

(I don't think I bit you...)

(I think that's a plus?)

(I'm just gonna guess that her advice isn't tailored towards us)

(Idk. Should we start with less open then work up to that?
I'm asking Natalie
One sec I got this
Natalie is the most useless piece of crap)

(😏😂 maybe it's more tailored to you)

(Bleh)

(😂 haha)

(Ugh I can't think of anything witty right now)

(Watch out she's your comp)

(I stole the words from you)

(Haha anti muse)

(Like an anti-muse 
😂 that bite was venomous)

(Anyways tonight was really really fun but I need to check out
I have a long day's worth of cramming ahead of me)

(That extra really is what tells me you're serious 😂)

(Really really really really)

(Oh crap yeah, I'm sending Nat to bed too
Haha goodnight)

(Really really real goodnight you need beauty sleep)

(Haha goodnight)

("Just finish already")

(Hey do you want to do something during PLC tomorrow? I have an hour and a half to kill before track practice... normally I just take a nap)

(Hmmm me too. Maybe. I have to leave by like 3 to get to practice but if you want we can do something)

(Alright well I might come up with something cool)

(Or not
We'll see)

(Well I'm 0 for 2 right now so you're carrying the team 😂)

(Haha maybe there's a geocache by del oro)

(Haha shut up)

(Honestly if we didn't spend so much time fawning over kittens and looking for flashlights, there were three right by Satan's tunnel)

(I should've known better than to trust any idea I had after 10 pm)

(Yeah but do you really want to live a life that doesn't involve fawning over kittens?)

(Touche)

(Hmpf)

(Okay I know what we're doing tomorrow)

(Care to enlighten me?)

(Nah)

(Half the fun is not knowing what comes next)

(Why do I feel like I'm gonna be late to practice? 😂)

(Eh don't worry about it. I wouldn't dare jeopardize my practice as well 🙃)

(Well it's good to know what I can count on in this relationship)

(Woah there)

(That word has a lot of meaning)

(Oh nice. I'm glad we're just two things "interacting" with each other)

(*meanings
People have friendly relationships, organisms have symbiotic relationships, Netflix and I have an abusive relationship
It simply refers to the interactions between one thing and another)

(That feels safe
Two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
Eh whatever. Now I'm getting all tense and nervous again. Let's just drop it)

(Safety is my middle name)

(I'm gonna go back into my shell again)

(Haha Ryan I literally just chose the easiest word for the job out of my vocabulary 😂
Don't over-analyze)

(See you tomorrow maybe)

(And I'm gonna go back into my bed again. Haha goodnight)

(For track haha)

(Oh and good luck! I have no idea why you're coming back to school though 😂)

(And maybe you too 😄)

(Stole the words from my mouth 😏😂)

(Right on, goodnight)

(Hey just so you know, after my doctor appointment I skipped on school so I can meet up a little before 2 if you want)

(Oh cool. I just finished testing)

(I'm just hanging with Nat)

(Messing around in loomis right now)

(Haha how was that? 😂)

(Complete awful. Tell Natalie she missed out)

(Yeah haha she says luci was a bitch today in class tho so you at least dodged that)

(Can you meet me in the pool parking lot?)

(Sure what time?)

(Right now)

(Damn ok)

(Hmm okay I'll look for you)

(Be there in 10
Here)

(Turn)

(I'm so lost)

(By the gate
I've never seen you in shorts 
The entrance from the road dude)

(I'm coming to you)

(I think the rational side of me will always get that. But sometimes it's difficult to turn off the little voice in my head that tells me that I need win approval - the gnawing fear of being a disappointment and not being loved in return. It sucks but I guess that's just how I was raised. I'll probably get over it at some point.)

(Stop!
Hey I just wanted to say that the only person who really knows you or can judge you is yourself, and you cant rely on outside validation if you ever want to be happy or feel like you're doing enough. Sorry if that's too heavy or like pointed and that it's coming kinda late, I should've said it in the car but I didn't want to push you too much in person because I know that can make things even harder.
I know just saying things doesn't really change the way you see the world or live your life but I just wanted you to know. Humans are social by nature obviously but the only way for someone to be able to transcend the pressure to feel accepted and truly be happy is to only rely on yourself for happiness. 
But that's just my two cents)

(And thanks Mollie. Somehow you always manage to be so kind and sweet at the right times.
Also I'm in class right now haha)

(Oh my god I literally thought I might've just totally pushed you out I'm so glad haha)

(Ugh it's soooo hard)

(But, you got it. Really anytime. Have fun with that third degree calculus 😂)

(The class is)

(Right. The class. Obviously)

(Haha alrighty)

(And every hour and a half
Nvm
Too much 
I'm out)

(Idk why I'm taking any of these tests)

(So how was your test?)

(Hmmm this is hard)

(Ok unless we get any more suggestions in the next like 10-15 min I think running joke has the lead)

(Omg you're one of those kids)

(I wrote a whole letter to the grader on mine 😂
College board I'm ready for my five)

(DOPE)

(Mmm that sounds exciting)

(Haha
Then I took a twenty min nap immediately after 
No ragrets)

(Almost as exciting as a 24 hr relay with "sick as dank" written on the backs of the squad)

(Honestly I'm okay with that name)

(Almost)

(At least it's "original")

(Tell us)

(Haha no I'm a puppet master)

(Wow you just be psychic 
Or unoriginal…
*must)

(You see... I am Jace.)

(911)

(Yeah and ever notice how he never looks directly at you?)

(Dammit
I was always suspicious of his unassuming facade and underground humor 
Obviously a hipster)

(If you looked into his eyes, then you would know the truth)

(That he has mild aspergers?)

(I think that name needs some more kick)

(Too much?
I didn't suggest Columbine Cruisers)

(Columbine Cruiserz)

(*Columbine Cruiserz 🔫)

(Aw yeah 😎)

(Sounds like an indie band)

(Sounds like something you'd listen to 😂)

(And all of their tracks are allegories for various school shootings)

(Gosh that got dark)

(No...it got dank)

(I just shivered with cringe)

(…Daddy)

("With cringe")

(What?)

(Ok)

(What)

(What's wrong with my grammar?)

(More like your perception)

(I'm so lost right now)

(But whatevs)

(You missed it. It's dead)

(Well okay then)

(So do you want to keep doing stuff? Because I'm very confused right now as to what's going on)

(Um do you?)

(Yeah of course I do)

(Me too)

(Oh good)

(Alright cool)

(Haha yeah)

(Alrighty then)

(Yeah so we'll come up with something. But I'm with you 100%)

(Haha ok good to know 😂)

(Hey what's your schedule with AP testing? I pretty much get out of school everyday at 12:20)

(You lucky shit)

(It was better last year when I got out at 10:45...)

(I pretty much have 8 hr test day
Except for gov. Idk when that one is though)

(DONT)

(Okay well now I think someone's just jealous)

(BACK TF UP
Haha when you went to read in the park 
Hipst)

(So AP gov is a morning test)

(Indeed)

(Mmm)

(And crew is a sort of later afternoon event)

(Mhm)

(Ugh you need to come up with one at some point)

(You're three for three my friend)

(I mean I have 101 more places in my head
But I want to see what you come up with)

(All of my creative juices go towards bad habits)

(Oh haha there's open mic night at Sierra College)

(Hmpf fine)

(How)

(?)

(Just how)

(I was going to go, but apparently it's terrible)

(Sometimes terrible is funny)

(Michael went and he said it wasn't even funny)

(Sometimes not)

(Not even bad funny?)

(Yeah he said he just felt bad for them)

(Like sympathy?
Like the painful kind?
Now what's gonna make me feel good about myself)

(Good thing I've got a surplus of intriguing and erotic ideas)

(Holy shit)

(*x!
EXOTIC
dammit nvm)

(You and you're Freudian slips)

(What're you gonna do 😂😭💁)

(I honestly don't know what to say at this point haha 😂)

(Finally
A white night appears)

(In this talk or el grupo?)

(Both really)

(Sometimes it's ok to leave things alone. Then you don't have uncomfortable draw-ons
Lucas got it)

(It's like a pimple. Something that you wanna mess with but probably shouldn't.)

(Stop spelling knight wrong)

(Nature will take its course
Like it did in the cultural cleansing during the golden days of the white nights 
Ok I need to go catch my dog)

(Okay then
In the meantime, I'm counting on you to come up with something worthwhile)

(Holy shit you're right)

(It's embarrassing really)

(FUCK)

(Ugh this is what happens when I hang out with peasants like you)

(... on to me.)

(The illiteracy is literally rubbing off)

(Okay I win
And I'm done
Go find your dog)

(You should've hit that bitch)

(I've just come up with the best date idea ever)

(Ok done
Small
Normal
Being the only one who votes for Del Oro Football is not normal)

(But it's gonna have to wait until Sunday)

(I'm intrigued)

(Okay tell me what times so I flesh some stuff out)

(And also racing at some point on Sunday)

(*can)

(I'll find out then let you know)

(Ugh)

(So you can flesh out 😂)

(10:56. I would imagine I won't be out until 1ish?)

(Ugh that throws a wrench in my plans)

(Maybe a little later?
What's the idea)

(It's nothing urgent, just an idea. I'll tell you about it tomorrow)

(Uggghhh)

(Hmm any bright ideas for tomorrow?)

(Hmmmmm)

(Honestly that second option sounds pretty dope)

(I might know a hike from Natalie but her directions are very unclear 
😂 I don't suppose you just want to watch Netflix and nap?
I guess I'm not the creative brain here)

(...As long as you don't pick anything lame)

(BITCH PLEASE)

(Oh gosh. I don't know if you should brag about that haha)

(IM THE NETFLIX QUEEN)

(I can think of worse kinds of queens 😂)

(😂 haha)

(Haha at least I'm committed)

(Okay so what's the plan? This one's all on you)

(Oh god ok)

(Yeah I nailed three flawless magical dates)

(One sec
Food then my house?
Let me check the house situation)

(Anywhere with me is magical)

(I just need to be back at Del Oro by 3:10)

(And you know it)

(Perfect)

(￼Oh so this has nothing to do with my Sunday idea but I thought it was funny)

(Sierra college has the weirdest events sometimes)

(How was this not your Sunday plan?!)

(I only saw it after class tonight)

(What is the damn Sunday idea?!!!)

(Um now I feel like my idea has too much pressure going against it
Too much hype)

(Ryan you hype me up all the time tell me the damn idea)

(No way)

(I don't think I've disappointed yet either 💁)

(EITHER)

(Frick)

(We're on even ground as of now)

(Maybe a little disappointment from you can make up any disappointment that might happen from me in the future)

(Haha that might be true.)

(If such a thing is even possible 
I really want to know)

(But still I don't see why I need to tell you right now)

(Cmon I can't take not knowing)

(🙃🙃 not telling. So you can stop now)

(It'll just be like a little cushion for me to fall back on 🙃)

(Hmpf. Fine. I'm taking a shower. Goodnight.)

(Yeah. I got it. Okay.)

(Notice the staccato style of my syntax)

(Good.)

(Fantastic.)

(Good.
Night.)

(Ok so what exactly is the plan?)

(Well I get out at 12:20)

(Also heads up papa's gonna be home for a bit but he'll just hang out on the other side of the house)

(Are your parents chill and everything? Like really I have no idea what to expect
Oh my god I just burned myself with the soldering iron)

(Yeah it's papa. He's the chillest 😂)

(Okay then I'll just come over at like 12:30)

(Haha ooh what a bad boy
Just let me know what you wanna do)

(It's starting to blister 😐)

(Please. You've got nothing on crew hands)

(Okay I'm here)

(Papa says he will not scare you 😂
Aight
So you might just wanna knock or walk in the front door when you show up cuz I'm fixing the toilet real quick
I mean text me anyway but if I don't respond that's why)

(Walk on in)

(Alright you know what, I jut forgot it okay)

(Interesting ploy, Jacobs)

(*just
Bring it to me tomorrow)

(Tomorrow?!)

(Haha if you want to)

(You want me to show up early?
Can't I just drop it off tonight? 😩)

(But just a fair bit of warning. If you do drop it off, then I need to explain you to my parents)

(Papas got you all figured out)

(Yeah I could say that if you want)

(Haha can't you just day I'm a Chem partner or something?
Or run to my car?)

(This ones up to you. It's your family)

(￼Well I'm going to this thing tonight)

(And I think we're leaving in 25 minutes or so)

(Omg)

(Haha my dad and his work friend)

(Alright I I drop it I'll leave it by the door or something idk
With whom?)

(What a cute nerdy family thing)

(Yeah...)

(Sorry. Didn't mean to overstep)

(Okay sounds good)

(Ok I'll let you know if I do. It'll probably be later if I bring it by)

(So I'm just going to throw this out there. Are we together and all that? Because if you want to come or meet us there, I could introduce you. I'm sure that would be chill
Plus VR stuff and lasers)

(Uh I kinda think so but I'm not really an expert here)

(Ugh me too... I just ran for like an hour)

(I'm kinda crusty and gross so I won't meet you 😂)

(Actually though there's something I've been meaning to bring up about this so give me a sec to get it all written out.)

(Just spit it out already)

(Ok, so not too long ago Noah and I considered being more than friends but I ended up turning it down because I just couldn't feel that way about him after being friends for so long. I'm trying not to let him know about us right now because he's always kinda been super competitive with you and I think I hurt him when I said I didn't want more and I think the idea of us would literally kill him)

(Yeah I totally get that vibe. That's fine with me)

(So if we could kinda just be on the down low for a while I would appreciate that
I don't really know what you're thinking long term or anything)

(As for long term, I don't really want to think about that. I figure that we have a little over three weeks together left - if we make it long. And we can have a lot of fun in the meantime and just play it by ear)

(Thank you so much)

(*that long)

(Good we're on the same page)

(Damn I can't sentence today)

(You can't cuddle either)

(Wtf I nailed that)

(😂🔥)

(*i nailed that)

(It's a two-way street)

(Wait 
Maybe you did a little)

(That's a good way to think about this)

(So what's the deal with my backpack? I don't have any homework)

(Haha ok gtg. Have fun doing nerd things)

(Pretty sure papa left it by the front door 😅 hopefully the dog is guarding it)

(Up up)

(Idk. You'll hear later. Don't worry about it
I guess if I really have to I can why up early 
*up
*get up)

(Damn)

(Okay sounds good)

(Hey do you have first block off?)

(No)

(Haha no 😂 That would be ridiculous)

(Do you? 😂)

(So where can I get my backpack? Earlier you complained about getting there early, so I figured you had first off or something)

(Right. Two blocks off. Ridiculous 😂)

(Well normally I just hang out in the pool parking lot)

(No im just late everyday 
Haha I'll meet you
Just tell me where)

(You're gonna make me hoof it up there with your skater backpack?)

(That's such a weird word)

(Hoof?)

(No backpack)

(To good
*to hood)

(**HOOF)

(*oof)

(It's a pack that goes on your back)

(Okay well I do need it for first block)

(😂 shut up)

(Everything will probably work out fine. Just don't be late to school
What's your first? I'm in Somers)

(Yeah yeah I got it)

(Oh dang okay)

(I'm down in the 600s
Just keep your phone on you)

(I normally don't)

(Whyyyy)

(Sarcasm sucks over text doesn't it)

(Make an exception
I'm walking your backpack up from boyington)

(Only if you're just weird enough for it to possibly be true 😏😂)

(Wtf okay)

(I need to learn all of hamlet tonight
So peace ✌️)

(He loses it. Everyone dies. Reality is a lie)

(Tyger)

(Go get em)

(😏 perfect)

(Oh damn I just realized my wallet is in my backpack)

(I'm going to be driving illegally tomorrow)

(Do I need to bring it?)

(Really?)

(Where do you live
I'll bring it)

(Address)

(Okay Chem partner)

(1001 dukelana Ln. Newcastle ca
Big yellow house on the far left when you come up)

(Ok. Pardon my grossness)

(😃 thanks)

(Give me 20 min)

(Call me if you get lost
Where are you?
Come back)

(Hey what are you doing?)

(Taking a nap)

(At 8:40?!)

(Screw that dance)

(Ryan you should be dancing)

(Ryan it's the last chance dance)

(Last chance for the last chance)

(Yeesh)

(What even)

(I'm guessing you're going then)

(Indeed)

(Damn don't lead her on 😂)

(But it looks like I'll be dancing on Natalie tonight…)

(Watch it. She's your top competition)

(Hey if you ditch the dance, we could have more fun...)

(More fun than a high school dance?)

(The bar has been set high hasn't it)

(I'm skeptical)

(It has)

(What time does the dance run from?)

(Though I might consider making time…)

(Just asking for a friend)

(Well I heard from a friend that it's an 8:30 to 10:30 kinda deal)

(Mmm okay)

(Though I'm sure I could get out whenever I wanted)

(Well let me know. Cause there's a million and one better things that you could be doing than that dance
For example, hydroflask shopping at target on a late Friday evening)

(Ryan she's mine for the night. Should've come to the dance and she would've been yours😏 you can have her at 10:30. Until then she's allllll for me😂
- Natalie lol)

(Whatevs I didn't want her anyways 🙃)

(Sorry bout that)

(- Ryan)

(Ryan I swear to god)

(Oh gosh)

(Guess like nats gonna be the one I'm making out with tonight 💁)

(Lucky)

(Oh and happy cinco de mayo)

(*looks)

(😂 haven't heard that one before)

(Damn
Yeah she is 
And you're mistaken. It's the Revenge of the Fifth)

(Why did I pay for this)

(Pay for what?)

(Get on my level 
😂)

(The dance)

(You paid already? I thought tickets are up front)

(Nvm I found the boys. Later 😘😂)

(See you later)

(Maybe)

(Sooooo what did you have in mind?)

(Shopping for a hydroflask at target 😂)

(Or I could teach you how to drive a stick. But it might be kinda dangerous when it's dark out)

(I'm adventurous)

(Mine's dick apparently)

(Danger is my middle name)

(🙃 dicks not bad 😂)

(Oh gosh. Double entendres right there)

(Fitting really)

(OMG no that one was not intended)

(Yeah are you carpooling with friends or what?)

(Ok but seriously)

(Cause I could meet you at DO)

(I've got a car)

(Are you going home first?)

(I I go home I'll never leave)

(Okay then. Well I'll meet you at DO at 10:25-30 ish)

(*if I)

(Can you bring me a t shirt?)

(Oh my god okay)

(Idk if I wanna be wearing cheetah top all night 😂)

(Thanks 😊)

(Okay)

(Wait maybe we should meet
I just parked next to Noah's me I'm kinda dodging other plans…
*and I'm)

(Well just meet me at target I guess
In your cheetah top)

(Bring a t shirt!)

(Yup)

(Hope you made it home alright. Sleep tight 😘)

(Don't let the bed bugs bite 😉😘)

(Hey do you want to do something tonight?)

(...that doesn't involve a deserted target parking lot at 2am)

(I'm so sorry about that 😂)

(Haha it's okay. Right now I just feel really close to you in the strangest way)

(Hmmm idk. Depends on if my family is staying or not)

(Me too. I would imagine that's normal 😂)

(Alright well maybe some other time then)

(Ugh sounds like I have to go see my sister and her boyfriend in beauty and the beast, sorry)

(Yeah crews about done so I'll be more flexible after that and we can hang out)

(Yeah same with track. Next thursday is the last day)

(Hmmm 21 days then)

(Make 'em count girl)

(Apparently I am haha)

(Oh gosh)

("Oh gosh")

(🙄 also I got a haircut. Sooorrrryyy)

(Ryan Jacobs!)

(Haha that's good to know)

(Now what am I gonna grab onto?
Lucky for you that your attributes aren't just skin-deep)

(I promise I didn't get a buzz again)

(😂 did you finally finger out the number system?)

(Another Freudian slip?)

(*figure)

(Nah I just showed them pictures)

(That ones on autocorrect)

(Mmm hmm. I'm getting there)

(Dammit why wasn't I using that the whole time?!
Haha you're getting braver 😂)

(I'm rubbing off on you)

(Ugh and stealing my shirts too)

(You're welcome
💁😂)

(We both know who wears it better)

(Nah you should keep it. Plus it's a little more feminine than I originally thought 😬)

(But if you insist. I will return it)

(Nah I just make everything look good 💁😂)

(￼)

(Haha what a sweetheart)

(Oh my god)

(I'm glad you like it 😁)

(I can't even
😂 this can be the new soundtrack we use)

(Even with all of that gift anxiety you apparently suffer from)

(😂 awkward timing)

(I'm not a hipster)

(I actually really like this, guess I'm developing a taste for hipsters 😉😂)

(Your YouTube history says otherwise)

(I guess I can't hide everything 🙃)

(😂 guess you can't keep your history of everything 
*off)

(That flaming personality just always shines through haha)

(Yeah I know... the days keep ticking down)

(Hey when is track over?
Cuz we've got 19 days…)

(Track will end between 4 and 5. Then I have class at 6)

(Time keeps on slipping slipping slipping, into the futureeeeee)

(Haha 😂)

(😂 I meant days but I guess that's good info too)

(Oh haha)

(Track ends this Thursday. Then I'm free basically all the time except for night classes
Also I found some more cool places today)

(You just never disappoint do you 😂)

(Okay this might sound a bit sappy. But I found this lot of cargo containers that you can climb on. If you ever wanted to bring a blanket and go stargazing with me...)

(Well I'm excited to keep exploring)

(What a little romantic 😂)

(Yeah it takes a while for it to get dark now. But maybe this Friday during GTD at some point)

(Sounds perfect)

(Oooh a scandalous side plot on the Staff team)

(Dope)

(I'm in)

(And maybe we can squeeze in something else this week too)

(Dope 😂)

(So all done with crew?)

(Yep. Celebrating by eating junk food and watching children's baseball)

(Hmm okay)

(Hmm?)

(Uh idk. Just keeping things in the back of my head)

(Plotting?)

(I'm always plotting)

(Careful. That PI won't let any more criminal offenses slide 😏)

(😐 oh I know)

(Haha it's ok. Everyone likes a little danger 😉)

(I hope that's not my allure haha)

(Allure from a dangerous romantic with a mysterious backstory? Not possible.)

(I'm so bored in class right now. Kyle and are completely checked out)

(Aww and that's the only reason you're talking to me)

(Kinda 😐)

(Ditch 😂)

(Nvm. Stay there.)

(Hmm?)

(Ya got me salty)

(Apparently my cheek tastes salty)

(😂 I did all that even after your races)

(Yeah thanks 😬)

(I deserved those CDs)

(Did you listen to the rush one? I was kinda curious on that one. I just saw it in the store)

(😂 you got it pal)

(Haha yup)

(I've been focused on wolf mother so no but it looks like it's their big hits 
Of course every song is a good one when you're a goddam prog Rock genius)

(What'd you think of the last two tracks? Those weren't on the first album like the rest of the tracks)

(Woah calm down there. I spent most of my driving time analyzing Far Away)

(Yeah it's basically the first album plus two extra tracks)

(😂 I'll keep in mind that those are special additions
Is that the disk that was playing in your car?)

(By them too that I liked)

(That was a long time to have text bubbles 😂)

(I'm like half typing haha)

(Kyle's bugging me
Uh also please take in mind that I just like those songs. Not trying to send any subliminal messages or anything so don't hyperanalyze the lyrics - it's not a mixtape)

(Haha bug him back. That bitch threw me down in third black)

(Bleh I thought it was the other way around)

(Haha I started to do that but then I got smart. Girls think with their head, unlike some other people I know…)

(I'm not sure which count you're referring to, but I would like to be clear that I could absolutely wreck Kyle domens ass)

(I'll let him know)

(Maybe)

(Use those exact words)

(I'm not telling him)

(Remember we're keeping it on the down low)

(You can't tell Kyle I'm the Chem partner and that's why we're texting? 😂)

(Nah I don't think that would fly)

(You give me so much fucking anxiety in class and I don't know why.)

(My natural radiance is intimidating I understand 💁)

(Yup)

(Haha sorry. You're giving me like sympathy anxiety. Just don't worry about it, cmon tap into that hipster side of you and be cool
And check your damn phone)

(Sorry I wasn't sure if waiting would be weird)

(Hey sorry I just went driving to blow off some steam)

(Call me if you want to talk)

(What's wrong?)

(It's not you, it's me)

(Is it me?)

(As cliche as it sounds)

(What though? Is something going on?)

(Kinda)

(Do you want to talk?)

(Can you just call me?)

(Ok one minute)

(Well my event's over, so I'm heading back to Newcastle now)

(Sorry about earlier)

(It's all good. I get it)

(Yeah that would be nice actually)

(Do you want to meet up or something? You could come over if you want or I could go to you
I'll be home in like 10 min)

(Griffith park by the Valencia club?)

(Ok give me 20 min)

(Yeah)

(That's where we were right?)

(Well)

(?)

(I'm getting better aren't I)

(Oh
One sec)

(Worlds better)

(Ugh 😑)

(See. Groups aren't awful. People don't notice 
Also Bree knows and she thinks it's funny that you pretend that nothing is happening 😂)

(Also I'm ditching practice today if you want to hang out)

(Ooh what a rebel)

(Yeah but KMO isn't even coming...)

(Wait isn't it your last one?)

(A bunch of us are going to the skatepark right after school, but I'm pretty flexible
(Not physically though))

(Ooh, the skatepark)

(I'm gonna eat shit)

(What a baddie
😂 I'm interested)

(Not physically)

(As long as you look cool doing it)

(Haha maybe)

(Send pics 😂)

(Should we all just pitch in?)

(Well my night class got out early)

(Or do we wanna do this separately?
Tent tent or like canopy thing?
Sweet
Is that a thing?
😂 we can if y'all want
The whole squad would be matching 
Sweet we can sneak in whoever we want 
Just put them on loose to whoever we give them to
Just the way I like)

(Ryan Jacobs your night class just started)

(Yeah and it just ended)

(Hmmmm)

("Choose your heart")

(Do I choose adventure or my responsibilities?)

(Ryan you're supposed to be trying to help your case…)

(Wait what case?)

(😂
Maybe something short)

(Omg you said "Choose your heart")

(Oh dang I just got roasted didn't I)

(Ok never mind)

(Obviously this level of wordplay is above you)

(Subtle roast)

(You did indeed)

(That's what I do 😂)

(￼Well there's one idea)

(Timing?)

(I have no idea)

(But I'm right here)

(Ok I need to at least start dinner so the fam doesn't lose it)

(I have no idea)

(And I need to go to target for nats birthday
Jesus why do I procrastinate so bad
When does that go to?)

(Honestly I'll just go to target with you)

(Do you wanna cook too 😂)

(I mean I'll give it a shot haha)

(I've just been granted two hours of free time by the Sierra college gods)

(Haha ok well I need at least 20 min to get their dinner going and idk if you wanna carpool or not)

(Let's do it. Your house is on the way to mine anyways)

(Haha ok I guess you can just show up whenever)

(Same)

(Just txt me when you're on your way cuz I gotta put clothes on)

(Okay I'll be there in 15 minutes ish
K here
Mollie...
How'd I do?)

(10/10)

(Fantastic decision on my part)

(Mom thinks you're a sweetheart, she doesn't even know 😂)

(I'm taking all the credit)

(Funny, mom gave me all the credit for "bringing you to the front door")

(😂 oh good)

(😂 I think she's just excited that you're not a girl)

(Also you'd better start texting first or else)

(Nngghhh)

(Yeah it's starting to annoy me a little bit 😐)

(Maybe
I guess I owe you for talking to me 😂)

(All good in the hood tho)

(Oh my gosh I just don't wanna feel pushy)

(Mollie you make me feel pushy)

(Like idk how much you want to see me or anything)

(Share some of the pain)

(Yeah but it makes me feel wanted it's kinda nice 😊)

(Yeah just work on it okay?)

(Hm I guess you deserve some of that too though
Ok fine 
Strong maybe)

(Okay good chat)

(Oh my gosh ok)

(I'm glad my first impression wasn't cowardly)

(😂 moms got a way of bringing out the best in people)

(I'm working on it 😐)

(Though I did get the credit for taking you in so maybe a little cowardly…)

(I guess we're both working)

(😐😐😐😐)

(😐)

(😘 haha goodnight)

(Ditto)

(Where are you?)

(On a field trip 😁)

(A field trip?)

(￼￼Nah it's that PCWA thing)

(Did you cut?! 😂)

(Props to you for texting first though 😂)

(NERD)

(Whatever they gave us free food)

(haha I saw my opportunity 😂)

(Ryan bring me food)

(Mollie focus on your mech projects)

(Sneak it out)

(Ryan ice been soldering the same wire for the last 20 min do you really think there's hope)

(Just got back to DO)

(*ive)

(How was your Susan thing?)

(I definitely ditched the rest of school 😂)

(Nicely done haha)

(Haha Susan was Susan. I managed by to read her book and still give a passable summary so I'd say it was moderately successful 👌)

(Anyways if you're bored I have 2.5 hours to kill until my track meet)

(You have another meet?)

(Yeah this is my last meet)

(Hmmm idk I just took my pants off 
Waddya have in mind?)

(Idk normally I would just go exploring haha)

(Haha ok well I'm willing to meet up if you want)

(Uh if you meet me at Del Oro, we can just drive and take random turns. That's how it normally goes 😂)

(Where do you wanna go?)

(Haha ok. Just give me like 20 minutes 😂 I need to get back into my clothes now)

(Wtf do you just strip when you step inside?)

(Ryan I wasn't joking)

(Haha that's so weird tho)

(Yes
I was hot)

(Whatever just give me a heads up
I'll be in boyington)

(Ryan my house is my castle)

(HOLY SHIT I JUST RAN MY BEST RACE EVER)

(Ok 10 min
I'm on the dirt
One second I gotta put on shoes)

(REALLY?)

(Haha no)

(LAST ONES THE BEST
IT WAS THAT 🔥
THATS WHY TWO KISSES
DID YOU THINK OF THE TRAIN)

(But I thought about thinking about it)

(It's the thought that counts)

(I freaking got first in my heat and ran the best one in my life)

(What was it?)

(Haha I thought of you)

(Really?!)

(As sappy as that is)

(Aw Ryan)

(That one makes sense tho)

(Sublimation?
Haha when I thought of you while I rowed I messed up 😂)

(😬)

(Sublimation or rowing? 😂)

(Whenever I'm around, trouble is near)

(Also maybe that other one too)

(See? Fire in the belly 😉😂😂😂)

(I think the saying is "fire in the loins" haha)

(Ok no definitely fire in the belly!)

(Maybe it's gender dependent...)

(Fire in the loins…no)

(Maybe fire in the loins is an std)

(Do I even have loins?
😂 I don't know
I feel like fire in the loins would not help me run 
Just sayin)

(😂😭 please don't have that)

(Kk)

(Ok but actually what time was it?!)

(￼)

(Hell yeah 🔥)

(HOLLLYYYYYYYYY)

(Second heat but whatever)

(DAMMNNNN)

(THATS A 4:56 ASSSSSS)

(It still looked cool)

(😂 I knew from the moment I grabbed it)

(...almost the same thing 😂)

(See? Good thing I got you there. You won and I got strawberries)

(😂 it felt like I won a four day long race when I pulled in)

(Some more than others 🙃)

(We both scored)

(Mollie I'm bored again
Come hang out with me)

(I didn't take my pants off sooooo)

(At granite bay's track)

(I guessssss
Btw I am very happy with my results 
Where you at)

(I'm watching garret run his last 800
Then I'm leaving)

(Awww)

(Alright will do)

(Haha ok let me know when
And where)

(Probably gonna be a half hour or so
So don't stress if you don't want to)

(Just keep me in the loop)

(🙄 ok)

(As long as we make it quick maybe we can celebrate a little)

(I don't even know what that emoji means)

(😉 ok)

(😏 that's the one I wanted)

(🙃 ok)

(Okay moving back over to normal chat)

(Good, it's hard to keep saving things)

(Yeah)

(Ok
Meeting?)

(How about Bank of America in loomis 😂
I need to deposit everyone's money)

(Haha ok)

(Alright see you in a bit)

(Give me like 10-20 min)

(That's about how long it takes me)

(Sweet)

(Are you still here? 😂)

(I just rolled in with all the sketchy 20 yr olds
Nah
People can bring them tomorrow for you
Don't worry about it
Bree I think they're by the track like last year right?
No)

(Dude yeah)

(Uh me too)

(Where are you
I'm in the parking lot)

(Uhhhh)

(Not Wells Fargo)

(By the skate park?
Next to the 20 yr olds)

(?)

(Bank of America)

(FUCK ME)

(Oh well I'll see you in a bit)

(Dammit)

(It's like a five minute walk Hana)

(*haha)

(Are you coming here or are we moving or?…)

(You can drive to me if you want)

(Otherwise I'll see you at do)

(Eh. DO)

(Alrighty)

(I'll get lost 😂)

(Ok don't
*done)

(Yes bring)

(I fucking did it again. I locked up. And now I'm sitting here in my car, hating myself for it. I'm so sorry. I wish I could stop it.)

(I feel like that's a good idea
At least for drinks and stuff)

(Mollie you give me so much anxiety)

(It wasn't bad)

(Yeah I just wanted to see you again)

(I don't know what I'm doing I'm sorry 
But nothing was bad
Except going to the wrong bank then not getting a kiss but whatever)

(Ugh I don't know why I do this)

(I feel but honestly it's fine. We have plenty of good times)

(Alright)

(Don't worry. We're about to spend the whole sweaty, stinky weekend together 
You'll see a whole lot of me pal
Scott you're a freakin doll)

(But there's so much pressure in my head even if it doesn't show
I hate it and I can't get rid of it)

(Ok I totally get that. It literally physically manifested itself in me but you don't act weird. You don't talk weird. You're witty and funny and other people don't see anything there)

(Okay sorry if it seems like I'm lashing out)

(We can be good separate and still be ok together Ryan
Other people don't have to know. I know.)

(You're lashing out at yourself)

(I know and it sucks)

(You're too worried about that because I think it's what you're used to but it's fine this is how conversations and feelings work)

(Ugh I hate feeling this vulnerable)

(Look. The point is, you're just thinking about things too extrinsically. People don't need to see that you like me, they don't even have to know. Feelings and emotions belong only to you and it's your business how you act on them and live with them)

(Okay well maybe some sleep will help me cool down. Thanks though. But I still feel like my head's going to explode)

(We'll talk later maybe)

(Omg rub one out and go to bed Ryan 😂)

(Eww Mollie)

(No worries. Maybe you need some of that good kush from Lucas)

(That's a taboo topic)

(Nothing's taboo anymore)

(Well I guess I'll see you tomorrow then)

(Honestly it'll help you think
You don't have to listen to my advice I just don't have any other 😂)

('Night)

(Goodnight. Good job today)

(So hmm)

(Ok who's got what kind of car?
Haha that's so funny 😂
Also are we wearing shirts or not tomorrow
Ugh fine losers
Ok but what about cars
Yeah jace!
Ok but what do people drive. I've got an FJ
We need to get the ez up to school
K how we gonna get this thing over there?
Can we just mark off a spot for it or does someone need to pick it up in the morning 
Probably 
Then get the ez up later
Ok so no shirts then?
Excellent
Sooooo has anyone been down to the track?
Because apparently the wind was a little brisk this afternoon…
Some snapchat stories are showing peoples tents blown into trees and stuff, just curious if we had anything loose
Hell yeah
Wait what?
About what?
Sorry, I don't think mine are your size 😂
Bree and I can't leave the lot
It's up to you)

(Yes?)

(I'm gonna snag you for a one on one talk)

(Alrighty)

(Jesus Michael's house is gonna be far)

(Though it sounds like we're rolling on over to mc danks then to Michaels sooooo)

(Okay just let me know. I'm gonna be running for a bit)

(Honestly this is so much fun Lucas's house is freakin lit)

(How's it hanging miss mollie?)

(Ok I'll keep you in the loop)

(It's hot and dank down under boiiii)

(Dank in the land down under)

(Always when you've got Mollie)

(Oh gosh it's hard to explain)

(Wait am I sending mixed signals like during this thing?)

(But yeah a little bit)

(What?!)

(Maybe that's it. I don't know. And a combination of other stuff)

(I don't feel mixed
I'm sorry
Let's do it entirely over chat
Come sulk on the track you damp rag
Don't be jealous)

(Crap sorry. It's just not weird for me to be like friendly I guess)

(Hang on I need to play this)

(I'm not really sure what's bothering you)

(Hey do you mind if I run with you?)

(You mean leisurely stroll?)

(Perhaps a light jog)

(Hmmmm maybe if you ask around for a bandaid for my blister I can jog)

(Tough it out girl)

(Lightly)

(Ugghhhhh)

(￼This is what I'm talking about. I freaking hate it)

(No puedo
Trust me I would much rather be there)

(Wow really?)

(Sorry I was driving. But yeah this has been going on for as long as I can remember. Little quips three or four times a week)

(If I wasn't at the fountains I totally would've gone in my running shorts that sounds awesome 
Hm I guess that's interesting but maybe it's just like a novelty to them?
You have two sisters)

(Like for senior ball, they asked if there were going to be any girls in my group. And I'm like wtf, yes there probably will be some girls. Half of the population is female
And all of the horror stories of college/high school friends meeting girls and ruining their careers
It's stupid, but it's been drilled into me from such a young age and it's hard to ignore it)

(Woah that's crazy)

(I think they'd like you. But they used to bag on Scott all the time for having a girlfriend)

(My parents are excited that I'm not gay
So maybe I should try to stay away from your family? I'm not trying to end your career I swear 😅)

(It's weird)

(Like playfully?)

(Oh whoops I fell asleep. Haha thanks for the ego boost. We can have a lot of fun in 14 in days)

(You know what? You're a senior, you're in college, you're super successful, screw it
Do what you want Ryan 
We've only got 14 more days)

(Haha I wish I could fall asleep. I'm planning on it)

(Oh wait, I just remembered that track is finally over 😂)

(I'm gonna have so much more free time)

(Andddd I'm gonna text you 40% of the time)

(I'm so ready and excited)

(You're gonna be so damn sick of me 😂)

(Do you have a picture of yourself? 😅)

(Haha sure. Like just a normal photo of myself? 😂)

(My grandma really wants to see you haha)

(Yeah 😂)

(Okay good, I thought you meant your grandma wanted one that Michael took last night)

(Which would be weird 😬)

(Ooh you can send that 😉)

(￼￼I really don't have any photos of myself on my phone 😂)

(They would appreciate it im sure)

(This is all I have haha)

(Awwww)

(Oh great, thanks Mollie for protecting me)

(What a cutie 😂 hopefully this will save you from having to meet anyone in person)

(Ryan my family thinks you are very cute good job)

(😁)

(I got you)

(Also there's a couple of photos here 😂lizrdazo.com)

("Classy, majestic banners")

(Pssh don't bag 'em til you try them)

(So hmm
Do you want to do anything today?)

(Uhhhh I definitely have senior photos sooooo)

(Haha alright. Just let me know because right now I'm lounging around trying to get through 250 pages of Life of Pi.)

(Unless you wanna hike out into wild flowers and watch me and my mom fight in front of the photographer no 😂
Mom really wants you to come here though 😂)

(How's the sunburn gonna look in your senior portraits? 😂)

(Hot. Like me 🔥💁)

(We all know that the gift is me)

(Haha what about Mother's Day? Go give your mom something)

(But yeah I need to find something today)

(Make a card. Flowers are at target)

(Mmm target)

(Haha i wrote that in my card 😂)

(Magical target 😂)

(Uughggghhhh)

(I'm still on page 25
Seriously fuck procrastination)

(Why are you awakeeeeee)

(Why are you up?)

(You need rem
Jut watch the movie)

(No! Why are you up?!)

(I mean it's not a surprise that I'm up)

(I have my own issues)

(Nature called)

(But it's 1:40 for you)

(Okay then)

(I'm going to sleep don't wake me up more go to bed)

(Also I just found out my favorite thing to do in Snapchat)

(Wait hang on)

(Ok)

(I just wasted 45 minutes learning this new feature)

(Goals)

(Best TV show ever)

(Look at Evans shirt
You're not alone)

(So I've been thinking)

(A dangerous pastime to be sure)

(Wanna see my house today? I'll sit down with my parents and just see what happens)

(Hell yeah)

(Maybe we'll watch Life of Pi 😂)

(Unless you really feel uncomfortable)

(And they can watch us watch life of Pi 😂)

("Curiosity killed the cat my friend")

(Curiosity killed the cat my friend 
But I'm game for everything)

(Oh I know)

(Put that in the quote book)

(Same)

(Ew no
I was under the influence of target 😂
And sleep deprivation)

(Target is a magical place
But everything good, bad, awful, and wonderful in my life comes because I was curious
It's a painful mess sometimes)

(Ryan you're waxing poetic)

(Take random turns in life)

(Same though)

(You might end up at target)

(😉 lots of fond memories were made there)

(What can I say? I'm a people pleaser 😂)

(You're gonna have to tough this one out)

(Haha ok I'm done
Ryan how do you make a divider
My hands are dumb)

(I'm not turning around)

(Go do some strides to calm down 😂)

(Ugh I hate it)

(I'm so sorry)

(It's all good fam. I get it)

(Wtf mollie)

(We only need to meet them I you want 
Your house your rules
Also is this like a sit down thing?
Like an interview?
Do I need to change?)

(Your fine
You're just going to hug and introduce yourself
Then we're gonna hang out by ourselves with a movie or something
*you're (can't let that pass))

(Hug your family? You made them seem lowkey kinda scary)

(My mom's fine. My dad's an awkward engineer sometimes)

(But I do like hugs)

(He just has a temper)

(I don't know anyone like that *sarcastically*)

(Chip off the old block I guess)

(Version 2.0
Less temper, and more romance)

(Must be all that exotic Chinese in you 😂)

(Mmm hmm)

(Okay I'm gonna go talk with them. Wish me luck)

(You don't need it)

(Our house is really really messy, just letting you know)

(Like reeeaaalllyy messy)

(Did you do it?)

(Uh not yet)

(Haha I feel
We'll clean)

(I need a power nap
So don't text me for like 20 minutes)

(Do some strides. Take a nap. Tell me when you want me over)

(I gotta kick you out at 5:30 so I can make it to class)

(But you can come over whenever, so probably 2:30 ish
Okay nap time
I'm going into moon mode
Hey you can come over)

(Aight)

(Nope)

(Did you talk to them? 😂)

(Cool)

(My dad's out cold cause he's been up for 32 hours)

(I'll just go to the door and introduce myself as your?)

(Chem partner? 😂)

(And my mom's going to show up at 3:45 ish with my two sisters from school)

(So I sneak in and out)

(You can say hi)

(That I can)

(Just introduce yourself)

(So I just called my mom and she's says it's fine
I said I'm having a friend come over to study and hangout
So you might be a surprise)

(And hug them)

(Yeah)

(Haha ok)

(Okay then
My house is a mess
It's awful. I'm sorry
Also text me the moment you show up so I have a heads up. I think my mom is dropping my sister off pretty soon too)

(Ok leaving school now)

(Well this is gonna be weird)

(Your mom beat me here
There she goes
Sooooo
 Can I come in?)

(She left)

(I *might* talk to you in third block)

(Your sister is here
Hey dont let me forget i have your check)

(Then you *might* get your $90 back)

(😐)

(Ryan help me make a tape divider I can't get past it 😂)

(After my nap, the hair on the back of my head standing up. Ugh)

(It's cuteeeeeee)

(It's raainnning)

(Wish I was there to see it 😉)

(I was jusssttt about to say that)

(I really want to hang out but I'm filming)

(Hmmmmm)

(Dammit why are you so helpful)

(Dammit there's only so many days left)

(That video better be worth it
Why are we so unfortunate)

(Also $2 Tuesday pssh)

(Also senior awards pssh)

(Frick. I just checked the weather. It's not going rain again)

(I guess the perfect date was never meant to be)

(Don't say that)

(Yeah maybe)

(We still have a few more hours of rain maybe 
We might have a miracle)

(Screw senior awards)

(Honestly)

(Apparently it's like 2-3 hours)

(If I can't find a matching pair of shoes I might ditch 😂)

(Wtf how do you get only one shoe of the pair)

(No no)

(Ohhh)

(Like match in my outfit
And also not being heels because screw that)

(Haha at some point I want to talk about heels)

(Talk about them?)

(I think they're fucking stupid)

(Yessssssss)

(They don't make any sense)

(Ryan you're my baby boy omg)

(Not even attractive at all)

(I don't get the appeal)

(Literally everything I like about you so much I can't even)

(Like seriously I'd like to walk around without consciously thinking about what my lady can and can't do)

(Plus I would just feel bad)

(YESSSSSSS)

(Okay that was my rant)

(Ryan Jacobs I could kiss you)

(You could)

(If only you had been here with me 😢)

(You have my sympathy 😂)

(Also this shoe business is looking like a real issue so my threat might not have been empty 😂)

(Honestly I just throw on the same black dress shoes every time. And I'm set to jet)

(😂 meanwhile I'm digging through my old church clothes)

(Shit I saw you with trey and I flipped out)

(Here are you?!)

(Yeah coming)

(I'll take you anywhere you want
Come on)

(Walking walking walking)

(Walkin where? I don't see you)

(Nice run)

(Taco Bell closes at 12am, so all is good
Now I'm gonna finish these gummy bears and feel bad about not running today)

(I feel like we burned some calories)

(Haha maybe a bit)

(😂 I've been feelin bad about that all week)

(I was going to suggest breakfast tomorrow
But then I realized it's nearly midnight. And I felt bad for you)

(100% will be asleep until at least 7)

(Whoops)

(Haha
You're really screwing with my sleep cycle Jacobs)

(Okay I should sleep though)

(Don't wake up in an hour!)

(Yeah that sounds like too much)

(Sleep until 7)

(And cut your nails)

(I did cut them... that's the problem)

(Please)

(Smooth them out 😂)

(Oh did someone say "again")

(Or just don't curl them that way again
Not sure how you did that)

(Yeah I'll file them or something)

(Thanks babe 😘)

(😘 night night)

(😂haha goodnight)

(Ssh don't tell anyone yet
But I just got valedictorian!)

(I toollldddddd you!)

(Stargazing *may* be an option tonight)

(Ryan Jacobs, valedictorian of our class 
😂 glad I can say that sarcastically still)

(Let's do it)

(Oh nice)

(Hey I'm free after school now soooo)

(Well come to Sierra with me. I can show you some sweet places
And maybe the art exhibit is still open 😂)

(Sierra college? Ok when?)

(Now?)

(￼Meet me here
You don't have a Sierra parking pass 💁)

(Haha ok)

(Kk)

(You're gonna have to give me like 15 min or so. I'm waiting for Lucas to bring my gown
Sorry
😂 also my aunt wants to meet you this weekend
Idk what I'll do)

(Tell Luke he's a cockblock
And okay I'll meet your aunt I guess)

(😂 will do)

(How old is she? Like a cool 30 year old aunt?)

(Aw
She'll be so excited 😂
What a little gentleman)

(Like a 50 year old married to a grandpa)

(At a softball game?)

(A cool German grandpa that plays softball
Which is where our meeting will take place)

("We won't hurt him 😎")

(Is that what they said?)

(Yes indeed)

(They want me to talk to their cool professor friend)

(Sorry I just realized I asked like 4 questions in a row)

(Yep)

(I'm really grilling you)

(You're a hot topic Ryan Jacobs)

(Hey my ego just went up 10x today)

(I get it. The air of mystery around me can be aggravating 💁)

(😂 from the BJ or valedictorian)

(It's gonna be a push)

(But I'll let you guess which one)

(Valedictorian 100%)

(Pssh I don't count my chickens before they hatch)

(Like you weren't gonna get it 😂)

(Hurry the eff up Lucas)

(I guess that's how you get to be valedictorian 😂)

(Mollie you don't even need it until graduation)

(Seriously
I might just leave)

(Just bail)

(Bailing rn)

(Smart idea girl)

(Pet smart here I come)

((Ha see what I did there))

(If)

(￼Okay Mollie, senior picnic this Friday ends at 2:00pm ish. Check-in for this condo is at 3:00pm)

(*ugh)

(If you're really down, we can do it. Just let me know. It's only $40 and we get it for 24 hours, but we don't even have to use the night part
I'm going to a video game all nighter thing for Jake that runs from Friday evening until Saturday morning btw)

(Oh gosh ok I'll see what's going on)

(Yeah it says I can cancel with 24 hours notice)

(I'm pretty sure I'm free I just need to make sure my alibi is super good
If you book it and something comes up are you able to back out or is it final?)

(Should I just book it so no  one else takes it?)

(Maybe)

(Yeah)

(This is probably really the only time 
Christ)

(It's okay though if you don't want to)

(No I do this just feels weird to think about and plan out)

(I know I know)

(I want this though. Even if we're leaving. I want my first time to be someone I care about)

(Same)

(I really really like you Mollie. And I feel like this would be pretty magical and sweet)

(You're always magical and sweet)

(Fingers crossed 🤞)

(Haha ok take your final Ryan)

(Just need a 60%)

(Surely the valedictorian of our class can get at least 60%)

(Surely)

(Haha okay I need to turn my phone off
All done 😊)

(Did it feel like at least a 60?)

(Haha yeah)

(Atta boy)

(I suck at chopping)

(Meanwhile I'm crying over some onions 
Too bad you're not here to chop for me 😂)

(Bleh)

(But those exotic eyes don't cry)

(They're too small 😑)

(How attractive)

(They're beautiful)

(Ah home sweet home)

(I love them 
All quizzical and bright)

(Okay Mollie, tomorrow is definitely a rest day
I'm spent)

(Same. I'm gonna need my sleep)

(Haha nice summary of us)

(Goodnight
Invader Zim is love, Invader Zim is life
https://9gag.com/gag/aWm5Q74?ref=ios.s.sms
Did you get a talk? 😂)

(No not yet haha. I was literally gone all day yesterday
Are you feeling okay? I feel pretty bad for keeping you up so late all the time)

(It's ok. I'm practicing living)

(￼Aww)

(And now I'm feeling great because Kenya gave me a new prescription and Susan says that your involvement in my life happened at the right time
You've just got everyone so excited 😂)

(What's this drug for?
Also I'm trying to take a nap rn)

(Nice and dark. Like my heart 😂)

(Nice nice. I hope it all works out)

(Haha it's for the same stuff but I've technically been under medicated so this should get more on top of the depression and the weird dreams
Fingers crossed 
Haha maybe I'll go do that too)

(Okay going back to sleep
Move here)

(To mask awkward noises? 😂)

(Uh yeah)

(I would rather not have silence)

(I concur)

(I have a boom box but it's massive)

(Size doesn't matter)

(Haha okay)

(Haha
Let me see what I can do)

(Also…are we set?)

(Uh no I still need to go to the store)

(And you're 100% sure?)

(I'm sure)

(Well okay then)

(I'm going to push-ups so I can get ripped
*to do)

(I'll do them too 😂)

(😉 of course)

(Get that blood pumping)

(Let see how many we can do in a row and compare)

(I hope you're kidding 😂)

(What I'm doing is getting into push up position)

(Oh gosh)

(Ryan)

(￼)

(Oh gosh)

(Shut up)

(😂 so can you drive rn or am I chauffeuring?)

(80% the brakes will be fixed tonight)

(But also my tires flat soo...)

(Ou just can't get it together can you?)

(I'm a nervous wreck)

(Actually right now or just in general? 😂)

(Nah it was just a joke haha)

(Probably in general tho)

(Maybe a little bit 😂)

(￼Look I don't know right now)

(Same
So driving?)

(Where's ya spare boy?)

(I do not have a spare boy)

(Haha just let me know)

(Boyyyyyyy)

(Haha okay see you tomorrow then)

(Okay then)

(Fine)

(Ooh fingernails 
*please* cut them)

(Also what's your college major? My dad wants to know)

(Probably neuroscience with a physics minor)

(First question: I guess)

(On the pre-Ned track 
*med 😂
Ooh is he vetting me?
Did you get a talk?)

(Second question: it never happened, so idk if it's gonna happen
But they sounded pretty serious. Like "Ryan, we need to talk tonight." But that was yesterday
He's impressed though 😂)

(Ugh 😂)

(I know)

(💁 I am impressive)

(Haha 😂)

(😂 make sure they know. I wanna be on their good side)

(Haha okay)

(Crap I need to go to bed
Ok I'm out)

(Sleep tight
Hopefully no weird dreams I guess)

(Hah you too. You're gonna need your energy 😉😂)

(Pssh whatever)

(Okay seriously go to bed. 'Night 😘)

(Fate is cruel)

(Hold tight girl)

(Now I'm getting Laura wet instead 😂)

(Well...)

(Lots and lots of plans are moving around)

(As in?)

(I'm in high demand)

(So I'm in Boyington rn
And I want to talk with you in person so we can work everything out
So how's everything going?)

(Everything? 😂)

(Haha yeah same. I woke up at 2:30 today)

(I can definitely feel it if that's what you're asking haha)

(Goalllssss)

(Shit)

(😂 I can't believe you still gamed all night that cracks me up)

(I texted the wrong person
￼)

(NOOOOOOOOOOO)

(Sorry I was driving)

(NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOURE GONNA GET A TALK 
NOOOOOOO
Ryaannnnnnn
Nooooooooooo they hate me
What were their exact words?
Oh god I'm sorry
Ryan they all saw it last night
Ryan respond)

(We'll talk later
Everything is good
But I'm in Loomis writing my Val speech with Matt
Maybe we can watch guardians tonight 😂
I'll be out in an hour or so)

(Ryan people know I'm sorry 😂)

(Well I'm done in 10 minutes)

(Ooh movies could be fun 😏😂
I thought you saw guardians Ryan? What'll you tell your family? 😂
Hey let me know your timing cuz I might go to abrasives later for the after party but if your around is like to see you)

(Really? Quick speech 😂)

("Yo whattup class of 2017. I'm better than all of you. Peace out ✌️")

("This award is better than all of you" 😂)

(Haha sure is)

(Aight I just got home)

(Ok I'm in granite bay at aleeyas party what's up)

(Nothing I'm just chillin at home)

(We can go buy you concealer for that hickey 😂)

(Ugh)

(Also what's "abrasives"?)

(Like the scratching thing?)

(Yeah I can see that)

(An abrasive surface is like a rough scratchy surface 
Or an abrasion is like a scratch or bruise 
Sorry stuff was going down at the party)

("Chug mollie chug!"
Earlier you said, "Hey let me know your timing cuz I might go to abrasives later for the after party but if your around is like to see you ")

(You know I do 😏)

(Ohhh. It's hard to type when you're sloshed isn't it)

(Wow that had a lot of typos 😂
Natalie's. She just got her bar up and it's gorgeous out there 😂)

(ITs HaRd to Type whEn Ur slOsHed)

(I'm glad you found the shift key)

(Ok but seriously let me know what you want to do so I can plan)

(Whaddya wanna do boy)

(What)

(I guess after last night I can give you the time of day)

(What)

(Ugh I'm not wearing make up)

(Do you need concealer?
😂)

(No)

(Sure I will)

(You'll wear that hickey like a man)

(Ok well I think movies theaters make for terrible dates. So I'm gonna throw that one out the window
I kinda just want to see you again)

(I'm intoxicating 💁😂)

(A bit yeah)

(Haha and lowkey nauseating but I can live with that)

(Alright we'll see how things go. Everything tends to work out in our case somehow haha)

(Well, it sounds like a couple kids are going to Natalie's and maybe sleeping out but idk if it's gonna be a tight squad thing or if it'll be open so maybe I can bring you around
Though my fam will probably be there)

(Everyone wants to get you concealer 😂)

(Yeah I think that might be smart)

(Haha ok
Until then?)

(Um are you free rn?)

(Hmm okay)

(Me too

And get me some concealer)

(Haha ok. Where do you wanna meey?)

(Well okay then 😂)

(Ok where 😂)

(Yeah probably let me talk with parents real quick)

(Target?)

(You're gonna get the talk)

(All set to jet)

(Tell them I'm a good kid and I won't corrupt you)

(Aight. 15 min)

(Target right?)

(I'm just going to assume so)

(It's always target)

(😐 let me know when you get here)

(Here)

(Oh I see you)

(Where's that cute little red car?)

(Where are you?)

(Hahaha)

(Inside?)

(Backwards or inside out 😂?)

(Ryan where are you?
Come help me carry
Test
My underpants are on backwards too 😂)

(Inside out)

(Oh gosh I just looked in the mirror)

(Haha)

(I'm frazzled 😂)

(My hair...)

(Ugh)

(I'm sneaking so hardcore rn I look like I was in a fight with a tiger 😂)

(Bleh)

(Haha it's cute
Like a little monkey)

(Alright well I'm crashing right now)

(Same)

(Mollie if you're home...)

(Update your iOS)

(Haha fine)

(You give me…?)

(I'm trying to discern this but it's hard)

(Exactly)

(Can you still see mine?)

(What does yours say 😂)

(Aww
I just figured it out
Really threw me off when you forgot the hyphen 😂)

(Indeed)

(It said "glad you're having fun" haha)

(Waddya mean? I'm talking about flies in butter 
Obviously
Alright yours
How close am I?)

(Uh I didn't realize that)

(Maybe I should step outside
Don't know what you're talking about. Seems fine to me)

(Are you kidding the grass is literally drying up as we speak)

(Embrace the freckles)

(I'm getting sunburnt I can feel it
Ryan I'm freckling)

(Apparently they're cute)

(They're goddamn adorable)

(Okay here's my plan)

(The sunburn is not 😂)

(I'm going to run to cripple creek
Then turn around and run back
Without you)

(You won't make it)

(Thanks for the vote of confidence)

(Too far
You'll die)

(Ryan it's 4.5 miles)

(Jeez yeah I looked it's a bit far)

(Hot, sweaty, miles of concrete and cars)

(Yeah)

(I'm still doing it. I like a good challenge)

(You couldn't even skate that 😂)

(You can still have them 😉)

(Wait
Ryan it's a lot
What if you get hit
Don't die. I want my six days)

(When no one is watching in the morgue)

(NO)

(I won't even protest)

(NO)

(We're takin necrophilia off the table rn)

(Pssh whatever)

(You can't go down if you're dead
That's a lot of work for me 
I can't just sit back)

(So will you be home for the next hour?)

(I am on house arrest my friend)

(Seriously?)

(Just me and my retainer and my six inside cats)

(And my cornfield 😂)

(Did you get in trouble for last night?)

(😂 not really but I definitely woke them all up. I have no idea what they think I'm doing)

(Hmm hopefully everything is chill)

(I just told them I wanted to sleep in my own bed and I don't think any of them realized it was 5 am)

(And they don't hate me yet)

(Well papa seems like he's still trying to convince you he's chill so I think you're good 😂)

(Haha I think you're growing on them a bit)

(Unlike your parents 
Who hate me by now 
I can never go to your house again)

(They really want you to come rafting with us now
But whatever. I need to start running)

(Really?!)

(Yeah I need to start running)

(Cuz they think I might be smart 😂)

(Uh I'm just bringing my phone)

(Oh god
Ok
Keep in touch 
How long do you think it will be 
So I know
Bring water
And phone and wallet)

(Which might die)

(Ryan no)

(Mollie I can do this okay)

(You might pass out
Just hold a bottle or something)

(Ryan charge the phone)

(Realistically 40 minutes)

(How long)

(But definitely under 50)

(No way)

(Idk I've never done this before)

(With hills?
Lord
Now I feel bad about myself)

(We'll see)

(Ok don't worry. You're good at getting the hang of things)

(Yeah haha)

(And apparently you last a long time 😏😂)

(Always full of surprises
Okay girl start the clock)

(Clock is started, prayers are said)

(Thickset)

(Lessdoit boy)

(Bleh
I'm dead
So many hills)

(What?!)

(I'm sitting outside)

(That's amazing!)

(Dammit Mollie)

(Ryan ask your family about a kitten I'm serious 
You need a pet
They're easy)

(I don't know. Maybe. I'll talk to them)

(Trust me. Unconditional love Ryan)

(Pssh)

(I'm pretty sure cats don't give that)

(Ok. So you need to feed them every once and a while and let them sleep wherever they want)

(Yeah dogs will love you no matter what)

(But I feel like that's a pretty low price. Basically unconditional)

(But I feel like cats are kinda meh. They do whatever they want
I'll think about it)

(But cats are super low maintenance so it's easier to convince them)

(Sounds enticing)

(And these cats are squids babies, they're super friendly)

(Isn't it your bed time right about now?)

(Trying to get rid of me? 😏)

(Oh I would never do that 🙃)

(Pfft whatever, I'm going to bed)

(Sounds like you 😉)

(Sleep on it. Sleep and dream about how nice it would be to have a little ball of joy curled up next to you)

(Mmm you just saved it Jacobs)

(Add me on Houseparty!
Username: ryanmjacobs 👉)

(Haha goodnight)

(https://go.joinhouse.party
Well I'm just hanging out with Kyle until class. I'm not gonna ditch him or anything sooo....)

(Ironically I just finished 😂)

(You too)

(It's all good. Have fun with your boyfriend)

(Also do you know if it's legal to take cardboard from behind the commons?)

(Yeah it's trash so I'm sure it's fine haha)

(Like do they care)

(Haha ok)

(Like they don't want it)

(Well maybe that's what I'll go do 😂)

(Uh well I'm in Rocklin at Safeway with Kyle and we're killing time)

(Do want to co-scavenge?
Like 5 min for target)

(Hell yeah)

(Okay we're moving rn. We'll be there in 5)

(Meet us where I parked last time
￼Felt like writing again)

(Why does that feel like a beautiful goodbye?)

(Don't worry, it's not goodbye quite yet)

(Just when I think I've got you you manage to astound me yet again)

(I dunno, I just felt grateful and wanted to thank you)

(Not for another three days at least)

(Aww I'm kinda proud that I have that effect)

(You know, for awhile I didn't think I could feel until I met you
It just seemed that I had grown indifferent, incapable. But I still get just a little sick and happy when you write me, and I still eat anxious when you're quiet
It must be the best feeling in the world)

(Haha eat anxious)

(*feel)

(Holy crap)

(Dammit
That's actually what I wanted to tell you earlier when you talked about your anxiety about showing people that you cared
You're afraid people will think you're weak for caring about others but it's really the opposite Ryan. I'm weak. I was so weak that I couldn't even bring myself to come to terms with the idea of caring. I had to completely shut everything down and live my life by a set of meaningless rules and rituals to feel anything other than a soul-sucking void. Caring is a strength. Love is a strength. It's the ability to put all your heart into something outside of your control and it's being prepared to take the risks that come with that because you know you are strong enough to handle it. It's beautiful.)

(That actually makes a lot of sense)

(Yeah it does)

(Especially that first sentence)

(Hang on I need to drive)

(I'm sorry I accidentally dissolved  into a pit of self-reflection because it took writing that out to realize it)

(It's probably good to offload that anyways)

(It's kinda nice to hear someone else with issues haha)

(Kid, everyone's got issues)

(Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday)

(But I'm serious. You're strong. And you're gonna do great things I just know it)

(That's five)

(You deserved that math award)

(Apparently)

(Anyways it seems like you have boat stuff all day tomorrow)

(Dammit you're right)

(And senior sunset runs from 7:30 to 10:00 I think)

(Stupid boat)

(Maybe we can squeeze something in. But it might be tough)

(Things always work out for us)

(Yeah things tend to work out)

(Wait is that tomorrow?
Lord)

(Tomorrow is sunset?)

(Yup)

(Hmmmmm)

(Sounds like a plan Stan)

(We'll see
I'll make the fastest boat that's ever raced and make time for you
It'll all work out)

(Holy shit did kyle tell you what he just found?)

(No)

(￼)

(What?)

(It issssss)

(I'm guessing you would be opposed to a late night excursion haha)

(Holy
DAMMNNNNN
That lucky shit)

(Honestly willing to do it for cardboard)

(Haha yeah and it's pretty late for you too)

(But he probably took it)

(Apparently you need beauty sleep)

(You have no idea)

(Pssh yeah I know)

(You should try it 😏
😭 but now there will be no making out and I have to do everything by myself tonight)

(What do you mean do everything yourself tonight?)

(…nvm)

(Oh gosh)

(Disregard 😂)

(Oh gosh)

(Oh yeah)

(Oh YEAH)

(Oh oh oh oh)

(just like that)

(YeAHHHHH)

(Girl I finish when I want)

(Ok you're done now
I will not indulge this)

(And it's always before me)

(Dammit)

(😂❤️)

(You always insist)

(I feel bad)

(Yeah I'm working on it 😅)

(And it feels kinda good for a little bit right before when everyone's really into it
I've got a need for speed)

(Next time I'll bring two)

(I'm looking forward to it)

(Eh I thought I would mind at first)

(Hot, sweaty car stuff)

(But it was pretty hot)

(It's always hot with me around)

(Hot)

(Haha ok I'm getting in the shower)

(Aight have fun)

(I will 😉)

(Oh gosh)

(Go go go)

(I don't know how to get the whole service for free)

(Laura wants to know how to watch hbo for free
You seemed like the obvious correspondence)

(But pirating tv shows isn't too bad
But you already knew that)

(😏 she seemed too goody two shoes for that)

(Of course she is)

(I wouldn't stick with the failure too long there. They want you celebrating successes because you two are the image of success up there)

(Pssh girl I know)

(You represent the best the school has to offer in the schools eyes
But it's very pretty)

(It's a work in progress
All about balance)

(We know that it you gotta get through the admins)

(Ugh)

(* but)

(Same. I'm about to bust this whole thing out solo 😂)

(I hope your boat fails)

(I hope the other three drown)

(I am a strong, independent woman and I'm gonna make the most kick ass boat that's ever sailed this pool)

(Sure sure)

(Where are you even making it?)

(La casa)

(Haha alright wing woman)

(Just spreadin the love, someone should be gettin it 🙃)

(We both know who that person should be)

(Is it the person damning their group to die a watery death?)

(I that's both of us really)

(*think that's)

(I concur 😂)

(Wtf mollie)

(Just got here. Baseball field?

(Hang back)

(I'm sorry I'm stupid)

(Nooooo

(How long? What's the timing)

(Idk it's just lunch)

(Just lunch)

(Man you're just determined to keep me in shape aren't you?)

(￼Holy shit a new update!)

(I thought my morning couldn't get worse 😅)

(This is the saddest PA song ever)

(You're here? 😂)

Come on)

(Maybe)

(Speed)

(😐)

(Just guess. You got this)

(Okay then)

(Hey are you there yet?)

(Just pulled in)

(Can you grab my meds from my dad? He's in the Denali nosed right up against stadium.)

(Yeah)

(🙏 please)

(Thanks)

(Mollie I don't see him)

(You're gonna have to do it. Sorry...)

(He's not in front of the stadium?)

(I looked, but these eyes don't see well)

(Shit)

(You're gonna be fine)

(I think
Yo are you guys all here? Or did you bail?)

(Front row baby)

(Wait that's you up top?)

(Very front row. There's a lot of space come down)

(Nope)

(And do you have gum?
Or mentos? 😂)

(I ate *all* of my mentor)

(Did he taste good?)

(Flip)

(The mentor)

(Bathroom break)

(Haha run down)

(I can sleep on you)

(I don't see you)

(Very front)

(Nah I'm lost)

(In front of the stage
Literally walk down it's empty)

(Ryan Jacobs)

(Wtf is the front?)

(Walk to the front of the auditorium)

(On the bleachers?)

(The stage)

(What stage?)

(THE AUDITORIUM)

(There is no stage)

(Ryan we're all watching the slideshow)

(Oh inside)

(Oh honey
Not the field)

(Okay)

(Inside)

(Okay 2 minutes)

(You're missing some quality cinema)

(So I'm in...)

(Now walk down)

(Okay)

(But I don't want to distract anyone
Are you on the left or right of the center?)

(You won't)

(Okay good)

(Right side
But close to center)

(Dumbass me left them in the car
All good)

(Dumbass)

(What's your schedule for today? Just asking for a friend...)

(*smartest boy in our school)

(Hmmmm)

(Well I'm on my way to go rafting with the fam)

(I'm guessing it involves a couple of trips but I'm not quite sure
Why about you?)

(Might hit a couple of grad parties, like Gavin's)

(Ugh Ryan why even ask)

(Well you know what)

(We have 3 days soo...)

(I was even toying with the idea of going on a run)

(Ooh good weather)

(Sooooo we gotta make them count)

(Perfect for rafting 😂)

(It's gonna be frigid 😐)

(Don't go in)

(Alrighty)

(Meanwhile I'll be having the time of my life, running hills like a champ. All alone and peaceful
Haha I gtg. Keep me updated)

(Have fun
I'm done now)

(Woah)

(We just finished dinner. Casual cheesecake for desert I think)

(Apparently I've been asleep?
Ryan Jacobs what is your status?)

(But I'm not really hungry
Also Mollie
Tonight is probably the last night we can have alone together, as sad as it is)

(I know)

(Aw you wrote me? That's really sweet and kind)

(When are you done? I conveniently have to go pick something up
Do I bring your letter now? Am I gonna see you again?)

(I've been writing you 😂)

(Shucks)

(I can tell my parents I'm going to see a movie haha)

(Haha ok. When are you out o the house?)

(I'm free like right now)

(Crap)

(Mollie I'm free for the night)

(I need to clean up
Ok let me know when you roll out and here you go
*where)

(I'm gonna try to be the same)

(Meet at Newcastle Produce? Haha)

(I have no idea where anyone is right now 😂)

(Or maybe I should meet you halfway)

(Haha ok. When?)

(Okay whenever you're ready. Just let me know 5 min before you head out)

(I need like 20 min at least)

(Ok)

(Haha alright)

(Bring water)

(Having a lot of difficulty getting permission to leave the house)

(Noooo)

(Hang on. I'm going to call you in 5 min)

(Tell them it's important to get something from someone 
Or for graduation 
Or to break it off with me before you go or something 
Ryan Jacobs what's going on?)

(Nvm no need for a call
Everything's good)

(Thank god)

(Soo... where's our rendezvous?)

(I'm grabbing something from my friends house right now but I can meet you wherever you want)

(Okay let's do Newcastle Produce then)

(Ok. I can be there in like 25)

(See you there)

(Wait nvm
Let's do Griffith park instead)

(You got it)

(My parents want a photo)

(Yo where is your thing?)

(3890 valley quail drive)

(Should I come?)

(Yeah swing by for a bit. My family wants to meet you 😂)

(Aight I'm here. So flipping tired)

(Sammeeeee)

(Well my parents are just leaving Izzy's.)

(You missed the flip
Aight when can we start showing up?)

(But my extended family is just chilling here
So I guess it's okay)

(Is the Chinese food there?)

(Uh................)

(No
Apparently I was let down
There is some. But there is a ton of Chinese pastries and pancakes
I don't think they cooked that much
But lots of pizza)

(Look for something that looks authentic Chinese and save it for me I'm coming over)

(Hi)

(Ryan your so cool)

(Yo mollie where you at?)

(Whoops
*you're
Ryan you are the freaking bestest person in the world
Ryan I can't compliment you enough
Ryan how can someone so grand as yourself manage to be human still?)

(It's finished kickin ass at go carts my dude)

(￼Same)

(*just)

(Guess I better come kick your ass now)

(Sorry when I got home I just slept in the car cause I didn't want to wake anyone)

(You make it?)

(and now I have stumbled inside
Back to sleep
So apparently yesterday my sister was poking and whispering to my dad, "Hey is Mollie wearing one of Ryan's t-shirts?"...)

(REALLY?)

(My dad mentioned it to me like 5 minutes ago)

(Omg
Hahahaha 
Wait
How do you know?
Who said something)

(He said something along the lines of, "Samantha was wondering...")

(Samanthaaaaaa)

(Haha)

(What did you do?)

(I just said uh yeah
I suck at lying)

(And?)

(Pretty much 😂)

(😂 you left it at that?)

(Then I just wandered off)

(You just leave em speechless don't you 😂)

(Probably not positively)

(Ryan where was the cover story
You had an opportunity 
You left them wondering 
Yeesh. Staying out late, wearing each other's clothes
What do they think of us)

(But it's funny
When they talk to relatives, they're vaguely proud haha
Like after graduation when they all wanted photos 😂)

(They're proud? 😂)

(*captured)

("Look at Ryan, he successfully caught a female")

(I would've dressed up more for your family 😂)

(Gotta catch them all 😉)

(Haha true
That's why they think
*what
I feel like a rare Pokémon)

(I'm just getting started)

(LA better watch out 😂)

(Haha)

(So tinder is pretty much Pokémon go)

(But with better character profiles)

(😂 of course)

(Okay brb)

(Ttyl)

(I need to pull an all nighter)

(Brb bbq wtf)

(Smh)

(Uh can it wait until after Europe?)

(Ryan my mom wants to know about the kitten
Ask your family)

(To give you the cat? Yes. To find out? No)

(Also I'm curious if you ever found what I did on your phone)

(Wait you actually did something?)

(Oh okay I'll ask soon)

(?!!!)

(Yeah scroll up in this chat 😂)

(Ry ry you're so cool)

(Life of PI?)

(😂😂😂 omg you really just wanted to hear that from me
?
Hahaha
Holy crap you did it
You used someone else's account to actually do something 
That's cyber bullying 
That's a felony
I'm telling the PI)

(I feel like it's more like cyber complimenting
Or cyber-ego-stroking)

(We all know how good you are at stroking)

(That's why I need that pussy)

(Okay I'm checking in rn)

(Haha ok 😂)

(Mollie I feel like a new man)

(What did you even do?)

("Groin alert on lane 2")

(Ride a train? 
Ryan I'm giving you Hobbes 
You need this pussy)

(No joke that's what they said)

(Wait what)

(Literally no one else got a pat down)

(Except me)

(WHAT)

(Sir that package is way too big)

("Groin alert on lane two"
I feel threatened 
Ryan you got stroked 😂 that's what happens when you make these jokes)

(Noooooooo)

(My crotch?)

(😂 what was it?)

(No what set it off?)

(Oh I don't know)

(😂 did they really go for it?)

(I think my pants looked too tight maybe)

(Like pat it done
*down)

(Yeah)

(Hahaha)

(Scott was just watching me)

(Was it a 90 min situation? Did it look like you had something in there? 😂)

(And this Indian guy was sticking his fingers in the waistband of my underwear)

(No like 5 min)

(Oh spicy)

(But a really long 5 min)

(And then he freaking hit my groin and I visibly flinched haha)

(HAHAHA)

(I was too scared)

(THE WHOLE GROUP SAW?
This is literally the best possible way this could have gone 
I'm so happy omg 
😂 did you get excited)

(The danger didn't do it for you? 😂)

(I'm gonna be on a three week dry spell)

(Hahaha 
You just made my day 
And I'm giving you a kitten
Since you obviously need some pussy)

(Unless I get lucky in Paris
With the boys 😉)

(Apparently you already got a little action)

(Spread 'em)

(Crack it open with the boys)

(With the boys
But yeah I'll have a small "chat" with my parents)

("Chat" is cat in French)

(However, I'm feeling a 90% no from my parents)

(It's a good sign)

(Maybe)

(Ryan)

(Sorry my coverage is spotty in here)

(It lives outside most of the time
It does it's business out there
It hunts its own food, it just likes scraps from you
It kills vermin
It loves you
What is there to talk about
I'm prepared tif have you the cutest and smartest one
*to give)

("Cutest and smartest" sounds like someone I know)

(I'm not sure we can still call you smartest after you failed a children's riddle 😂)

(I'm telling you, my mind is miles above that low level crap)

(I'm middle management material)

(Mmmhm right)

(Mollie what are you gonna do for the next few days?)

(That ego stroking worked)

(Literally everyone is gone)

(And I literally don't have a car)

(You're becoming a cat lady)

(Guess I'm running)

(Haha do it)

(I'm scared
My body is going to waste away. I need to do something at least every other day)

(I wasted away. It feels bad)

(A incredibly intelligent, highly motivated and driven individual who will succeed in life despite his deteriorating physique?)

(😂 you've been scared a lot lately
Do jump squats and push ups 
Ugh
What will you be to me without that sweet sweet butt?)

(Probably nah 😂)

(I thought we already discounted one of those attributes 😂)

(Screw off Mollie)

("Motivated and driven"?)

(Screw off)

(Repetitive)

(I can't do that anymore)

(Redundant for extra emphasis)

(You ruined it)

(Haha what)

(What)

(Yourself?)

(Screwing off rn)

(I'm so confused
I'm not sure if innuendos are being made)

(When aren't innuendos being made)

(Dammit)

(Yet another sign of your inferior intellect)

(Hey wanna have a bit of fun?)

(Finally)

(We both know that you can't handle my pace)

(That would be a nice change of pace)

(Anyways before I board my flight at 4:00, here's my little sister Amanda's phone number (916) 298-9631
If anyone wants a kitten it's her, convince her and she'll convince my parents)

(Per usual, I'm doing the dirty work)

(Nah I don't think so)

(Let's have some fun
Am I gonna freak her out if I text her? 😂)

(But I'm curious
I'm 99% sure that phone number is good. We'll see)

(What?!)

(Yeah we'll see)

(Text her and see!
Ryan it's your sister)

(This one's on you haha)

(I can't believe this)

(Anything?)

(Here we go
I have sent the first missive)

(Not yet)

(What did you send?)

(Just responded!)

(Haha she's so formal)

(Wait
￼
She's on it)

(Jeez yeah)

(Uh uh)

(Haha reminds me of some other Jacobs 
Actually all of them
What's up with that)

(Uh huh)

(I'm so casual 😂🙃😐🔥😬🤞🎉😉)

(No)

(My phones at 18%)

(None of that
That looks like my dads texts 😂
One and done)

(My attentions at 5)

(5/5?)

(As always)

(I wish)

(Okay we're leaving now)

(Bye bye)

(See ya later)

(Legislator)

(Glad you went out in true Ryan fashion 😘)

(Wait Mollie I want to see what you wrote in that first text)

(￼)

(Just curious that's all)

(What's up?
Thy was a quick flight 
*that)

(Oh damn I guess we're using labels now 😂)

(😂 I wanted to be sure she knew who I was)

(Mmm hmm)

(Made official over a feline text to my newly 9th grade sis)

(Please, she graduates Thursday)

(Damn this plane is so slow to board)

(She seems like the cool kid
This will be a story to tell your grandkids)

(Is it a pond hopper? Cuz then you got awhile)

(Uughghh)

(Darn, reduced to talking to me)

(I'll settle)

(That's exactly what I said)

(Low-key roasting yourself there)

(Glad we're still synced)

(Right back at ya)

(Boiiiiiiii)

(Buddy)

(That's what the spelling looked like in your drunk text)

(Wait what's the deal with the cat?)

(Boiiiiii)

(Also I'm 9 hours ahead of you btw)

(I know I know. You are getting a kitten)

(Hey something got screwed up with my carrier. I can't send texts unless I have wifi)

(Huzzah)

(Bleh
So what happened exactly? You actually convinced my family?)

(Haha. Your sister did)

(I'll try)

(She just asked for pictures and when they could pick one up you're getting a cat 😂
Pls don't eat it)

(But mom gets hungry sometimes
So are they picking it up before I come back / you leave?)

(Nah. They need like another three to four weeks until they're good to go)

(Oh okay that makes sense)

(But they might come look at them idk)

(I told your sister you would bring her over 😂)

(Maybe)

(Haha)

(Go crack open a cold one with the boys for me)

(Will do, will do)

(Haha we just finished dinner and I'm getting ready to go to bed
And you're just starting your day)

(It's like 6 over there 😂)

(Almost 7:00 haha)

(Haha
I'm sooo jealous)

(Force yourself to stay up like one more hour trust me)

(Tick tick)

(You gotta set your clock)

(*tock
￼
Okay leaving the wifi)

(😂)

(Move here)

(You're getting a cat)

(Oh nice)

(She just texted back saying. They said yes and I emailed her pictures 
Ryan you're gonna finally have a pet)

(Hmm I'm surprised they said yes
How many back and forth messages?)

(Like two)

(Haha that's funny)

(Literally she just texted back to say yes and to say to email her pictures)

(She's very formal)

(Hmm that's weird)

(I tried to lighten it up with a haha but that convo is full of lead 😂)

(She's definitely the social butterfly of the family)

(Like everything made in China)

(And she texts constantly)

(Haha)

(Maybe you scare her
I'm going to pretend that China joke didn't happen)

(You know it was good)

(Idk maybe)

(My leaden lover 
Mmm
Haha scare her?
Am I scary?)

(Like she doesn't know acceptable behavior with you. Are you a friend?... etc
Doesn't matter though; getting a cat)

(I mean I'm hopefully not an enemy I'm giving her a cat 😂)

(Uh)

(Haha true that
Ryan why is my wifi working on my phone and not on my pc
Help)

(Did you try rebooting? 😂)

(Doin it now)

(It was a joke haha)

(Why do I ruin everything nice 😂)

(But it might work
Haha I don't think my family realizes how much they need me
I kind of secretly fix everything without them knowing)

(I need you to come to my house)

(I'm like a magical computer night elf)

(TAHTS going in the quotebook)

(Mollie is there really a quotebook?😐)

(You'll find out)

(That would be a beautiful gift mollie)

(Shhh
It's where I go to relive every beautiful cringey moment)

(Stop right there)

(You never signed my yearbook girl)

(STOP RIGHT THERE)

(Haha maybe I guessed something correctly
Or maybe I took a gander in your room when you were asleep)

(Ryan you haven't been in my room)

(Still nothing?)

(Wait what
Creep
You know nothing
Go to bed
I'm gonna put my fist through this computer)

(Hmm okay before I go back for round two of attempted sleep,
Do wifi networks show up on a list?)

(Yes)

(But yours just doesn't connect)

(It's connecting to the wifi but there's no internet connection)

(Try turning off your phone's cellular data and see what happens)

(But my phones on the wifi and it has internet connection 
Idk)

(Just to isolate whether it's your wifi network or the computer)

(Shit)

(Yeah maybe 😂)

(It's the computer
What have I done 
Ryan when you come home you should come over and look at my computer stuff…
Pretty please)

(I'd make it worth your while 😏)

(Okay definitely now)

(Services will be exchanged 😉)

("Jobs" as it were)

(Dammit)

(That blows
Also I watched La La Land
It was okay, but I think it was overhyped)

(Definitely overhyped. I didn't really feel it)

(Yeah and the last twenty minutes nailed it right in the feels)

(But I really like the piano music)

(And it was an interesting idea, like how it was shot. I could appreciate that)

(But the lead up was too slow)

(Oh yeah)

(That was almost a waterworks for some reason 😂)

(Yeah great cinematography)

(I must've been feeling fragile)

(Haha perhaps)

(Oh well, some movies are good to see just say you have)

(Solo?)

(I did take myself to see guardians of the galaxy today 😂
Quality film
As you know)

(Haha no one's home rn)

(Obviously)

(Teşekkür ederim)

(Me myself and I
The whole crew
Yay)

(I'm sorry I don't know what that means)

(Google will tell me)

(It as just in my autocomplete and I was curious)

(*was)

(Thank you)

(￼)

(😂 manners are the first thing they stress)

(I have three choices
Gonna go with nah)

(What inspired that choice?)

(Okay I'm going to bed at exactly 4:00 am)

(So 5 min)

(Your general lack of commitment)

(Pssh)

(Ok
Exactly five min)

(So like 2 min our time)

(Ugh)

(Pssh yourself)

(Oh right, the Mollie-Ryan time coefficient is like 0.33)

(^^^quotebook)

(Yeet I made the cut)

(😂 you're the whole book)

(Only two of my favorite people have made the cut apparently)

(Okay let's have a conversation only with autocomplete)

(No)

(Yeah I'm getting all that stuff)

(I'm not gonna let you know if you're gonna get it)

(I'm so confused 🤷🏻‍♀️)

(Okay 👌 I'm going out with you)

(Ok 👌)

(Nah you just don't want me)

(This is hard
Shit we're almost out of time)

(In other news, I ate exactly half a pie today)

(All autocomplete 😂)

(Ooh look at you)

(Haha "I'm not gonna let you know if you're gonna get it"
Okay 😐
That's a lot of pie)

(But it is closely related to whether or not you fix my computer 😂😏)

(It's over blaow)

(Yeah
Instant regret
I will be thoroughly shamed tonight
Times up)

(Snap back to reality
Op there goes gravity)

(Oop there goes gravity)

(Sometimes there are winners)

(And sometimes there are losers
And sometimes, just sometimes, there are those who suffer from jet lag and desperately need sleep)

(That would be a loser, Ryan)

(xoxoxoooooxxxoxox 😘)

(Sweet dreams, hot cheeks)

(xxx 😏)

(If only 😏😘)

(Mollie I'll be so horny when I return)

(You won't know what hit you)

(When you return?)

(It'll be like a tsunami of testosterone)

(Fam I'm already there)

(Okay 'night)

(My bruises will be nothing compared to what's coming 😂
Haha alright go to sleep)

(How's it hanging miss mollie?
Anyways I've got 20 minutes of wifi at this cafe before I hit up some geocaching haha)

(Omg nooooo)

(Wow this internet sucks)

(Pride was lost
Jk. None to begin with)

(I can't even snap a chat
Haha I tried texting you earlier
But Rome's wifi is not on point
There's literally a backlog of 5 clever texts that never went through)

(Haha same)

(Holy crap we're actually online at the same time)

(Awww
I want them all
And stop asking Bree for pics!
Trust me you don't wanna see)

(I want them all)

(Omg so exciting!)

(I'll tame the beast within)

(Nooooooo
No no
Trust me it will ruin it
I embody a different persona in the desert
A more primal, savage being
You couldn't handle it)

(You're not the first
Well maybe)

(It's the beast without that worries me 😂)

(So what are you doing right now?)

(Shouldn't you be out adventuring...
It's like 3:40
Or 4:40
Idk)

(Ooh look at you)

(You're not good with letters)

(So good with number
S)

(Haha Ryan the desert is a lady you woo by night)

(Oh you should've sent that last text first)

(And by day you avoid her and sleep off the adventure
It's like an affair)

(Then I would have understood right away)

(Oho yeah I bet. Ryan Jacobs and his roman lover)

(Dammit)

(When in Rome…)

(Mollie send me a Snapchat
Mines bugging out because of the crappy wifi)

(Snap or text?)

(Well both)

(But the texts are working okayish
But I have a bunch of failed snaps queued up
And I want them gone)

(And I want them)

(So send me one so it wipes it)

(Nooooo)

(￼)

(I want them!)

(Dammit they're still queued up
Ugh
I want them gone
It's too much)

(I wanttttt them)

(Haha it won't even let me see yours until all of mine send)

(Haha glad to see I'm the heart
WE HAVE THE SAME BATTERY
We're synced)

(Too bad. They're quality snaps)

(You don't know that)

(I don't even remember what they were haha
I'm never tapping that retry button
You'll never get another one from me again)

(We'll never snap again)

(The end of a love story)

(My selfie album is at an end)

(The end of an era)

(The end of Sarah)

(SARAH)

(Haha I may also have an album of you)

(Wait what)

(Ostensibly)

(No)

(It's weird I swear)

(Hmmm
SARAG
SARAH
Specifically
Jesus
You have something to say
No
Alright then
Back to my acronym)

(*not weird)

(What part of this 😂)

(I tried sending a jpeg haha)

(And my phone flipped out because the wifi sucks
It was sending for like 5 minutes straight until it failed)

(Awww that was me all morning)

(I'd need at least 1000 words)

(Haha describe it
Paint me a picture with prose)

(You've got it)

(Dammit)

(Jk
I'll give you ten
Go
Go go go
Drop it hard
Hit me)

(Okay well I need to take a shower
Maybe I'll be back
Or maybe not
It's 1:08 am
And I just cut myself with a razor
Badly
Like 4 times in one spot
It stings like hell)

(Hahaha where?)

(Nah Ben gave me some fancy shave butter)

(Shaving the ol face pubes?)

(And it sucks
Not worth it)

(You don't have enough to make it worth it)

(Wax in the City?)

(You'll never be one my level
Let go get waxed together and see who gets more hair pulled off them 
#fundateideas)

(Yes)

(Hey guess how many geocaches I found today?)

(Only thing better than geocaching 
Also my idea 💁)

(Zero)

(Yeah that's about right)

(-1 since you lost my favorite boy)

(Woah you got that test?)

(*text)

(I'm telling you. There's angels up here)

(Yeah eventually)

(Hence the name
Angels landing
You found him right?)

(After he wandered like 1 mile out of the way
Well hang on
I need to know if you received my other texts too
Like all of them say failed to send on mine)

(Idk. I know you lost my favorite boy and I know you went looking for geocaches)

(I think you summed up my life)

(And I know you're a subpar shaver and hair-grower)

(I think so too)

(Like a heavy weight lifted off my chest)

(How does it feel)

(You're welcome 💁💪 I know you can't handle upper body)

(After four weeks of nothing?)

(Good thing I'm so strong)

(I doubt it)

(I have been very active I'll have you know)

(Mmm hm)

(Pssh maybe four weeks is too long for someone as frail as you)

(You're only half)

(Isolated gene pool)

(I'm the real deal, purebred all the way baby, this model doesn't expire)

(Low genetic diversity
Poor immune system
Uh huh)

(Well we didn't want to mix with any lesser breeds…)

(Fantastic model)

(Would you cross a Lamborghini and a corolla?)

(Hmpf fine)

(I thought not)

(We're done
And I'll have you know that I'm the lambo)

(No you're the cross)

(I'll put you on the cross)

(Half-breed)

(Nail me, as it were)

(YEAH)

(Okay mollie
I'm going to sleep in 5 minutes
Spend your time wisely
Cause it's almost 2 am)

(If I spend my time right you won't be able to sleep)

(Haha I wouldn't mind)

(😉)

(Alrighty then)

(Kick us off lambs)

(Smooth...)

(^lambo
Shit
There it goes
Faster than a lambo)

(Wait one more thing)

(What?)

(Mollie streak with me)

(Snap streak?)

(No)

(That's up to you friend)

(Normal streak)

(Streak streak?)

(Lessdoitgirl)

(Naked?)

(No wtf)

(I'm listening)

(What's streaking)

(Yeah I get that)

(Ryan naked running is streaking)

(I was just messing with you
A snap streak *might* be kinda of fun
*might*
As long as it doesn't involve too many selfies of myself
It's a little sad that my longest streak is with trey but whatever)

(Aw damn)

(Feet aren't weird Mollie)

(His longest streak isn't with you
I'm sorry you had to find it like this
Fine
But you might get some weird stuff)

(Some people are in to that stuff)

(*some*)

(*mollie)

(I know what you're getting at 
I got you
But if the opportunity to real streak comes up I expect to participate)

(Don't check your Snapchat)

(Haha gotta do it at least once)

(Why not)

(Goodnight sweet prince)

(Ugh I wanna see it)

(You won't sleep
Just don't)

(But I literally can't even
If I click on it, it'll try to send my backlog of snaps first
Which it won't be able to, because my internet sucks)

(Excellent)

(Oh hey my snaps sent)

(The only streaking we'll be doing is the naked kind bud)

(Oh god you got everyone else's too)

(A+ quality)

(Lo siento)

(Dammit I have no idea if or when my texts go through)

(Ayyyy I got it)

(KRaltsys)

(Test test
Assdfghjkll)

(Holly crap that one actually says delivered)

(Go hanksville!)

(What?)

(Hanksville Ryan. The only place in Utah with service)

(Ah)

(Damn mormons)

(Shahshjasbs
Look at that wifi speed)

(Nigsjjsnd dk)

(So fast)

(That selfie was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen)

(Yeah)

(I think aleeya has a better sense of composure)

(I agree)

(Well I guess you'll never find out)

(Props to you for not looking bad next to her 😂)

(I'm never dancing again)

(That tells me I have accurate information)

(I'm okay with that really)

(We will never see each other dance)

(I'm burning with curiosity)

(Mollie I'm feeling this alcohol)

(To know how that tawny body moves
Haha)

(Are you feeling my steamy text)

(All the jokes are gonna go over my inebriated head)

(Mollie I'm seriously feeling it though and I don't want to do anything stupid
Anyways I'm going to stay up until like 1:00 my time if you wanna text more. But I'm going to turn off my phone for the next 30 min while I eat)

(Aww and lose your buzz)

(Don't worry that's gonna last for a bit haha)

(Don't be afraid to be crazy 😂)

(Aw geez)

(Mollie you look ridiculously tired)

(Goodnight Ryan Jacobs, sorry for being such a tease all the time)

(Tired of your shit)

(First of all, don't know Spanish)

(Haha no im just lowkey ugly 
La vida)

(Second of all
All flowers are beautiful)

(That's literally such a basic phrase)

(If you cake them with enough make up)

(I think that was an insult)

(Nah)

(Bitch)

(Mollie you're gorgeous)

(Worst metaphor yet)

(I know I don't tell you enough. But no joke you're the prettiest girl I know in this really cute way)

(Ok shut up
Being real is fine
Better than cheap stuff)

(You're adorable)

(Ugh)

(Shut up)

(I'll take it
Thanks 
I guess you're cute too 
But saying it makes me feel weird)

(You definitely say it enough
So I know when you're lying)

(I never am)

(Haha I don't feel uncomfortable)

(Alright we've both been made uncomfortable enough here
Glad we got this out of the way)

(Don't what you're on about
And I'm sober too)

(You said shut up)

(Haha I meant when you said saying it made you feel weird)

(I assumed discomfort)

(Haha oh)

(Fine)

(Sharing feelings just does that 😂)

(Won't happen again
I like how our dinner time lines up perfectly with your lunch haha)

(Aw don be like that. 😂 I like to hear yours)

(I might be)

(We're syncing periods again
Beautiful
ARE YOU SCREENSHOTTING ALL OF BREES NASTY ASS SNAPS OF ME
RYANNNNN)

(Just the cute ones
I need something to look at during these long ass plane rides)

(NONE OR THEM AREEEEE)

(Shut up mollie)

(You're so frickin cute)

(OF)

(In that little hat of yours)

(NOOOOOOOO)

(And your t shirt haha)

(I can't afford any more freckles 😂)

(Girl if anyone has freckles it's me)

(Ugh)

(Own it
They're cute)

(Beautifully contrast with the yellow backhround)

(Yes yes)

(*background
Art)

(Spotted brown on yellow
And spotted brown on uh
Reddish pink at this point
You're looking a little warm)

(I'm feeling a little warm)

(Wat)

(It's really not great
But I just spooned all the group I've put of our pitcher into my water so my life is turning around)

(That sentence doesn't make any sense)

(*icw)

(Alright talk to you later)

(*ice
Hey it's been raining at home 
You might have a second chance
Ryan what size shirt are you?
I think I know but idk
Respond dammit I have one percent)

(Dipping out of wifi for a while
Oh shoot
Sorry
I know right? I've been looking at the weather
Btw I'm between a medium and a large, depending on the brand haha)

(Hmmm ok)

(So I'm obligated to get you something now?)

(Haha what a compact little man)

(I pack a powerful punch
Jk s'all good)

(Idk are we doing this?)

(Haha maybe)

(I'm prepared to leave it at postcards I was just told that this was expected)

(We'll keep it unique and special
Just like us)

("Special")

(Yee lessdoit)

(I need a yes or no)

(But probably not a shirt unless you absolutely know I'll love it
I'll get you something good tho)

(Hmpf fine)

(Dammit mollie don't worry about it)

(Oh god I'm so stressed)

(The postcard is fine
Honestly the fact that you considered it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside)

(Aw me too)

(Okay same)

(But I'll probably still get you something now)

(I've still got a week)

(What was that? 😂)

(My frickin internet keeps lagging out)

(I am aware)

(What was what?)

(You were texting for like three minutes but decided not to send it 😂)

(Oh)

(Yeah that would be the crappy wifi
Or you could imagine that I was composing a beautiful and poetic paragraph just for you
The decided against sending it)

(The latter option would just drive me crazy)

(*then)

(Finally)

(?)

(What)

(It was driving me crazy)

(Okay I'm not sure what you're going on about)

(Your poor grammar)

(Still confused)

(It was driving me crazy)

(Doesn't matter though
Thanks for derailing a perfectly okay conversation)

(I'm not even sure which conversation I derailed 😂)

(Fine)

(There were multiple)

(Well we're on this one now
iMessage seems to work fine now
It's 12:27am and no one is hosing the network)

(Awww)

(*us)

(Perfect for you)

(Awwwww)

(I know)

(Goals af
If only it weren't through a computer)

(Ugh)

(Perfect for you)

(Shut up mollie)

(😂 nerd)

(Or I'll replace you with a computer)

(You know I love it)

(She's pretty cute too)

(Like Karen from Spongebob)

(She has a nice wit about her)

(You can become a millionaire through the sex robot industry)

(Yeah stroke that ego)

(Haha
Like someone else I know)

(I swear to god
If I invent that
I will name the prototype after you)

(YES)

(And every lonely dude in the world)

(That was exactly what I was about to say to you actually 😂)

(Will be banging mollie)

(Robomollie)

(How romantic is that)

(Syncing up again bleh)

(Witchcraft)

(Nice song)

(My favorite)

(So what're you doing rn?
Like obviously I'm just maxin and relaxin in my bed)

(I'm supposed to be napping)

(Ah same I guess)

(But instead I'm talking to my favorite boy)

(Supposed to be sleeping)

(…but he's not responding so I'm talking to you)

(But I'm taking to my girl)

(Taking)

(Talking)

(TAKING)

(Oh)

(Just choosing to ignore that subtle burn?
I see)

(I thought you were referring to your dad
🔥🔥🔥🔥)

(That doesn't even make sense 😂)

(Yes it does)

(Nice try both
*bitch
Dammit)

(No)

(This conversation is going downhill)

(You're just hurt
Cuz I won 
You can't flip that one 
It's ok
I like you for more than your brains)

(Spice it up girl)

(Going down)

(Mmm teeth)

(What's hotter than going down?
Using teeth? 😂)

(Wifi
Flaking
Out
Ugh)

(Like my skin in the desert)

(Bleh)

(Ugh
You sure you're not just trying to get rid of me and play computer games 😏)

(Pffft)

(So...)

(Um....
How's it going?)

(Um…)

(Fix it)

(I made it through the pass
Which is more than the dinner party can say
So pretty good I guess)

(DONNER)

(Haha)

(Effffff me
I haven't slept in a while as well)

(😂 that was evident
You looked so tired in some of those photos)

(Shut up)

(I slept in till like 11:30 today)

(That's just my face)

(Tired of everyone's BS)

(It was great)

(oh god)

(How can you not?)

(I don't even get that this week
I'm so jealous)

(It's frickin summer)

(I have responsibilities)

(Uh huh)

(You slag)

(Okay)

(We both know it's true)

(Well this trip is pretty great so far)

(Haha how are you?
And your sad excuse for a pillow fort)

(And honestly trying all the alcohol is pretty fun haha
And the sights of course
Paris has been my favorite as of yet)

(The city of love)

(And I hope you realize that the pillow fort isn't real...)

(I was also quite enamored)

(Aight I'll count on it)

(Obviously
That's hardly a pillow lean-to 
I'll show you how it's done when you get back)

(Isn't it like 3 am?)

(Nah)

(It's more like 4:02)

(RYAN)

(Haha 😂 I wanted to chat with you)

(Whyyyy)

(No)

(Haha perhaps)

(Really?
Thoughts of me keeping you up? 😏😂)

(But the wifi is cooking at top speeds after 2am
It's like the only time iMessage will work properly
And I knew you were getting back around then)

(What a romantic)

(Yeah did you drive the whole way when your shift started?)

(Haha luckily I got back 😂)

(Indeed I did)

(Mollie no)

(Anything is possible with enough double shots)

(Mollie yes)

(Haha a lot of places get confused when I ask for decaf here)

(So I end up skipping the coffee)

(Yeah cuz decaf is dumb)

(Mmm)

(What an American 
You're all sorts of exotic over there)

(All the white people burn here haha
It's hilarious)

(I'm glad melanoma is a joke to you)

(Ben, Noah, most of the girls)

(And Scott and I are just chilling)

(Wait till you see my group 😂)

(Mmm)

(Mmm spicy Scotty)

(That hot mex mix)

(You won't send too many more snaps of him if you know what's good for you 😂)

(What?)

(Why not)

(Ahhhh)

(Is someone getting jealous?)

(All that alcohol has made you dense I see 😂)

(Oh gosh
So many people have come up to me and asked if I was dating you)

(Yeahhhhh)

(Even Mrs. Isaac)

(WHAT)

(And she didn't even ask)

(Holy crap what
What do you say?😂)

(She just said she knew)

(Woahhhh)

(Apparently we're a hot topic)

(Lord
How have you been handling all that attention? 
😂)

(We definitely were on my trip)

(Oh no)

(Some awful jokes went around 
Maybe Nat or Bree will send the video 😂)

(Like what?)

(Haha nothing)

(Yeah you girls like to talk. Ashely came up to me and said that literally all the girls know)

(You were just go-to joke material
As always)

(And you as well, are the punchline to a lot of jokes)

(How)

(Haha mollies not ok)

(Literally how
WHAT
Lil' ok me?
*ol')

(Just ol)

(I don't see how anyone could joke about such perfection)

(Pssh whatever)

(Shuddup
You of all people 😂)

(Hmpf)

(Like what the jokes? Or the fact that they're all talking about us)

(I'm so curious 
What's going around?)

(Just all of it)

(Oh haha)

(😂 I'm so curious)

(Like last night
We were walking back to the hotel for a bit. And there was a couple in the front of the pack that apparently looked like me and Emily
And he had his hand in a choice position on her backside haha
And Lauren and a bunch of girls 100% thought it was me
So yeah you were the butt end of a lot of jokes there
Like "oh should we tell Mollie, Ryan?" Or "Ryan, do you like to switch it up every two months?" 😂)

(DAMNNNN)

(Some of those were sooo frickin cute though)

(Hahaha
Aw
People finally know who I am
Awesome
My trip thinks I'm leaving you for Bree 😂
Hmmm maybe that's why she was sending all those nasty snaps
Trying to get rid of competition 😂)

(Wuuutttttt)

(￼)

(I don't know what you got so I really have no idea 😂
They probably weren't though
Haha)

(Look at those little dino hands
Awww)

(AHHHHHHHHH)

(You're so adorable)

(NOOOO
That's crusty af)

(I'm not adorable)

(I could hug you right now)

(I'm a motherfucking badass)

(I don't know if those t rex arms could swing first)

(I would beat you up
No you couldn't)

(THEY WILL BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF YOU)

(Oh I don't know about that last one 😏)

(ITS A COMFORTABLE POSITION
IT REGULATES BLOOD FLOW
I WILL DOMINATE WITH MY SUPERIOR INTELLECT)

(Says the boy that couldn't solve a children's riddle)

(Okay first of all, I was tired)

(And only speaks one language
And needs every slang term ever used explained to him)

(Secondly, I know like 10 programming languages
And lastly, uh...
I got nothing)

(That's right)

(I'm good at written)

(And code is pretty much all derived from one common language 
And is only written)

(That's my forte)

(Good at written)

(Adequate at the written word)

(Much smart, very intelligent 
Good at written)

(Dur hur)

(Maybe even proficient)

(Maybe)

(Just maybe)

(Racing to catch up to me)

(Mmm hmm)

(Girl sign my yearbook already)

(You couldn't take it)

(Wait for what?)

(My unbridled talent would absolutely drive you mad
Best to wait)

(Can't even follow basic conversational prose)

(And yeah that's what was confusing)

(Tut tut
Wait to see what I'm capable of)

(It's not like you could sign it right now...)

(It's not like I'm not writing you already…)

(Pssh fine)

(Now whether or not you'll ever see that writing…)

(Shuuttup)

(Might be a different story
😏)

(Too much hype girl)

(The chase is half the fun)

(Is it though?)

(Is it?)

(You're still here)

(Apparently)

(Everyone's a sucker for mystery)

(Hmmm I must leave you now)

(Yeah I was gonna say)

(Have fun in your pillow fort)

(I'm getting a bit tired
It would be more if you were to join me in my fort
Just fyi)

(Oh I'm very aware)

(Haha pretty sure that was a Tigger quote)

(Patience is a virtue
All in good time 
Ta ta for now)

(Nighty night miss mollie)

(You knew!)

(Haha I loved the tigger movie as a kid)

(Ugh 
Leave me burning like that
Typical)

(❤️❤️❤️)

(Looking back it had a pretty deep message for a kids movie)

(What happened to the movie industry
Ugh go to bed)

(Yeah goodnight)

(￼)

(I hate the fact that this exists now)

(You can be my pet)

(But it's close in color
Almost tawny)

(Almost tawny)

(Mollie this wifi is cooking)

(Just like you)

(I'm calling you)

(No)

(Yes)

(Wait I have to leave in like 5)

(Aww that's okay)

(My beautiful jokes don't flow over the phoneeeeee)

(Mine don't either)

(We can be slow together)

(Lessdoit girl)

(3 min tops)

(Haha 😂)

(2 now)

(￼)

(￼)

(Bree was kind enough to share your art with me 😂)

(Dammit bree)

(What a babe. Smart and artistically gifted? How did I get so lucky?)

(I feel like we were communicating through her haha)

(The boys over there are keeping me in the loop 😂)

(Like who?)

(Tell me
So I can end them
Probably Jace)

(A magician never gives away their tricks)

(Magicians also never get laid)

(Or maybe the do and it's own of their secrets)

(Tell me Mollie)

(*they
*one
Damn
The certainly make a lot of women disappear)

(Who is it?
￼
Nonononono
It's gonna be so hot
Ugh)

(Literally)

(I bring the heat apparently)

(It's you
It has to be
It's been raining here)

(HAhah you make everything hot)

(HAhah)

(Damn)

(hAHa)

(Dammit)

(I'm not pulling another Thomas conversation)

(Then why did you start one)

(Made it back to bed)

(Ya dumb bitch)

(Water contained)

(Same)

(What)

(Barely)

(What)

(How are you in bed?)

(And what water?)

(I'm an independent person who can do what I want)

(Yeah that's typical for you)

(Don't worry about the water
Idk nvm I'm tired)

(If you don't want to chat that's alright honestly
I'm tired too)

(Haha shut up)

(How's the sleeping going though?)

(I need the beauty rest)

(You do too…)

(Like everything's chill?)

(😂)

(Uhhhh)

(Aw mollie no)

(I mean kinda
On the trip there were some pretty bad ones and I just stopped sleeping for two nights straight)

(But I've been sleeping at home kinda)

(Aw I'm so sorry)

(It's just at weird hours and stuff. Like hard naps that last like 4 hours
At least I'm not remembering any really awful dreams rn)

(And don't tell me not to feel bad
I really wish the best for you)

(You should feel awful Ryan, clearly everything is all your fault)

(Partially at times)

(Ha)

(I know. I want the best for you too)

(Aww)

(Eh, I think that helps me sleep)

(Haha same)

(Sweet dreams are the best dreams)

(Maybe I just couldn't sleep on the trip because I couldn't get that release 😏😂)

(Haha I might have had a few of those nights)

(If only)

(And you're not?)

(Not what?)

(Ya know)

(Oh yeah)

(Honestly mollie)

(I'm curious I'm sorry)

(I've only done it once since we've been together)

(Which is weird
Because before us, it was at least four days a week
Which is about typical
Sorry if that's tmi)

(Right right)

(Uh first date)

(Nah it's pretty much the same all around I think, people just don't talk about it
By together do you mean first date or first time?)

(Woah really?)

(Yeah)

(I don't know it's weird
Like I don't even need uh
Visual assistance
Like the desire isn't there anymore)

("Visual assistance")

(I mean it's there)

(Is going in the quotebook)

(Right now)

(But I like you more haha)

(Aww)

(Than any model or whatever)

(Haha I actually think the same thing kinda happened to me)

(Yeah no joke)

(Aw really?
Dammit)

(In my honest to God option, you are the most attractive woman I know
Opinion)

(This was my reliable thing before you showed up ass)

(Haha)

(Woah
Stop
You're too far away To work me up like this
You're making me
blush 
It's freaking me out)

(I miss you mollie
Can't wait to come back and hug the crap outta you)

(I know. It's freaking me out)

(The jeans will do the trick)

(Looking forward to some bruised ribs 😂)

(I can't wait to feel those jeans pressed up against me)

(Ugh just thinking about it is too much)

(Just being that close to you again
Ugh
Uughhh)

(That's the sound you make)

(I'd rather not)

(Haha
Think about that)

(There, calming you down?)

(A bit haha)

(I'm good though
I've got top willpower
Sooo much endurance)

(Yeah but you don't wanna be up all night with this 😂)

(Oh and guess what 😂)

(My stuffs been hovering between $26 and $29k)

(Holy)

(😂😂😂😂)

(It's soooo much)

(Woo now you're heating me up)

(I'm scared)

(😂)

(I don't want it to crash
But I've got this feeling that it's not a bubble
I hope I'm not wrong)

(It's ok. You've had a good run. I think you've got a good instinct, no point in worrying about something you can't really control)

(Yeah me too)

(I'm here for moral support obviously 
😂 I'm just impressed at how far your savvy ness has gotten you)

(Basically all I do is ignore everyone's advice and do what I feel
Seems to work)

(Same)

(Aww same)

(You were the first time I did that
No regrets)

(Why does everything seem to work out?)

(Is this the calm before the storm?)

(I sure hope not)

(Maybe we just finally get a little sunshine in our lives)

(But it seems effortless. Everything random and good is falling into place)

(Maybe it was our turn)

(Ugh I hope nothing bad happens)

(Maybe bad would be good though. Then we can split easier 😂😭)

(Ugh don't say that girl)

(Ugh
Let's be real I don't either)

(You're gonna jinx it)

(I know I know)

(Yeah same)

(I don't even know what to hope for
I dug myself in deeper than I ever thought I would not gonna lie)

(Really really same)

(Aw look)

(Okay back)

(We're synced
As always)

(I had to go pee)

(Haha)

(Yeah I should too)

(Now I have to go
Whyyy)

(Good talk though)

(Yeah you should sleep)

(Oh dang haha)

(Also I meant pee but whatever 
Haha goodnight, Ryan)

(Synced again 😂)

(Witchcraft)

(Nighty night miss mollie)

(Sleep tight)

(￼)

(Y tho)

(😂 yum)

(What about kylee?
Are you talking about her sunburn?)

(What was that 😂)

(Oh shoot I didn't know that)

(Nah she was super dehydrated and stumbling and stuff
But she's ok now)

(But everyone got sunburnt yesterday. Badly
Even Scott haha)

(I sawwwww)

(Uh...)

(Haha that was one sexy snap 😂
I think she just didn't drink or anything, idk
It was an excuse to snap 
Why are you up?)

(So
Stargaard is taking us on this hike to a monastery that has a cool view
I thought we were supposed to be in the lobby at 6:00 or 6:30...
Turns out we leave at 7:15
So eff me)

(HAHAHA)

(But if I fall asleep idk if I can get back up)

(Just take a nap)

(Woah coming close to your bedtime girl)

(Ryan Jacobs king of naps?)

(Scribe?)

(Haha I know
I'm so tired
But I have to scribe tonight
So looks like I'm up for awhile)

(Is that Susan stuff or me stuff?)

(Indeed)

(Wat)

(Neither)

(I have a life outside of you two)

(What the hell are you scribing?)

(Mm hmmm
Haha)

(I scribe for my autistic friend)

(Oh that's so sweet of you)

(There's a disconnect between his thoughts and ability to physically put pen to paper
So I do it)

(Really though)

(There is minor compensation 😂)

(Frick mollie)

(I'm not that great Ryan)

(Not purely out of the kindness of your heart?)

(Honestly, if they hadn't offered I probably would have anyways)

(Well at least you're writing haha)

(It's kinda cool
Like fascinating)

(Shut up)

(Well if I can't read short stories by Mollie...)

(You can read shorts scribed my her?)

(Maybe)

(*by)

(Tell your friend to think of a story
Haha 😂)

(It's all he does😂)

(Makes sense)

(Haha
Maybe he inspires some of mine
Not that you'll know)

(You two are probably on the same level)

(You know what)

(Uh uh)

(That's a compliment 
And I don't see it any other way
And I'm noting that you have something again st people on the spectrum)

(Well actually that's one my greatest fears
I feel bad for saying it
But if I had an autistic child, I don't know what I would do. I mean I would still love them and all that
Like I'm really scared of that and I'm not 100% sure why
Mollie respond. Tell me I'm not a terrible person)

(Sorry, driving)

(Yeah)

(Having one is?)

(I don't think that's unreasonable. I think that people base their ideas of happiness and success off of their own personal experiences and I think that knowing you have an autistic kid makes it hard for you to make that kind of similar personal connection.)

(Ugh thanks Susan)

(Like you never know if you've really given your kid the world
They're almost a stranger)

(That makes sense though
Basically I have low empathy
Haha 😂)

(Ok I could have just called oh a bad person 😂)

(Mollie I don't think that was a problem per we)

(Not really but it's in the vein of empathy 
Weird, Natalie just called me that
Why do all you guys have so many problems? 😂)

(*se
Whatever
I think I might go take pictures of the sunrise right now)

(I think that's a great idea)

(I have so much time to kill right now. And no one is up yet)

(And I'm about to go down)

(Wait you're not sleeping in your room?)

(To sleep
Forget that one
Go take pics)

(I will I'm just sleepy is all)

(Good for you)

(Like any minute I might nap off)

(Well maybe I'll call you again sometime. I kinda like the sound of your voice...)

(Mmmmm)

(Omg I was brushing my teeth)

(I guess I don't mind the sound of yours)

(And in the hostel communal bathroom there were two topless Swedish girls in nothing but towels for their lower half)

(Nicceeeeee)

(Mollie no that's not cool)

(Pics or it didn't happen)

(Okay well I'm leaving to find breakfast)

(Haha)

(They were speaking Swedish)

(How did you know they were Swedish?
Is that just like a normal thing there?
Damn
We live in the wrong country)

(And yeah they were super upfront about it
Just turned around and said hello
And I was like where tf is your top?
Dammit every place is closed till 7:00
Dammit every place is closed till 7:00
Sorry about that. My texts are being buggy)

(Did you talk to them?)

(Woah 11:00)

(Dammit
The one time you could talk I was scribing 
I'm putting that in the quotebook)

(That's late for you
No you hang up first)

(I did)

(No haha I didn't)

(Dumb bitch
Did you call me moll? 
😂 is that my nickname)

(Probably just cut out
I don't know how I feel about that nickname)

(Don't)

(Haha he knew?)

(Haha 
Noah thought we were doing 📱🍑🍆)

(How'd he not know it was my mom or something?)

(He could hear my melodious voice drifting through the halls)

(Did you like our artwork?)

(Which?)

(￼)

(Oh god
What girl doesn't want pictures of the twin towers?
And the awesome power of early 2000s air travel?)

(I hope that's a clip you're using 😂)

(Of course)

(Anyways that's all I got)

(I feel like that one video perfectly sums up your Europe trip)

(Yeah pretty much my reaction at every monument)

(You're good)

(Typical Asian tourist)

(Hmm so...)

(If I show up in Loomis before 11:00, will you meet me?)

(Of course)

(That's the plan apparently)

(Even though I'm pretty sure I have to leave the house at like 7 the next day
I'm willing to make that sacrifice 
But for conversations sake, what do you think the probability of that happening is?)

(So idk 70%?)

(Oh hell yeah)

(Nicole Howard's house in Loomis)

(That's exactly what I wanted to hear 
Felix and I will be waiting 
Where do I get you?)

(I'm pretty sure I'm carpooling with them
Then you can drive me home 😄
Like good ol times)

(Awwww)

(Haha well that's never the plan is it)

(Does anything happen in between driving home and picking you up?
Out of curiosity)

(Honestly it's not)

(😂 I know)

(Kissing may occur though)

(Maybe
But probably not)

(Maybe)

(Probably just a high five)

(If I decide I still like you when I see your face
Maybe)

(Maybe just a fist bump)

(Good point)

(High fives seem like a lot of skin contact)

(Let's resort to brief and brisk eye contact)

(Then a silent car ride home)

(With an awkward cat on my lap)

(I will of course provide the cat)

(Ewww no)

(There are four fully grown ones and I've kittens to choose from
*five
Then there will be a courteous nod to your family
And I chauffeur myself home perusing my fantastical late night thoughts 
Ryan my dad and I just found a dead mouse full of maggots)

(I poked it with a meter stick)

(Feed it to stumpy)

(Stumpy deserves better)

(Great)

(And between us, I think each of the kittens already had a turn with this thing 
You will probably receive similar gifts from stumpy when she moves in
It's cats way of saying thanks)

(So I have that to look forward too)

(*to)

(Dammit)

(Indeed
Sometimes they bring cool things like snakes and birds)

(And sometimes they're still alive)

(Screw grammar)

(Is this something you explained to my family? 😂)

(No)

(This was in the fine print wasn't it)

(Don't tell them
Stumpy might be like a midget cat or something too
So maybe you'll only get small things
Just check your front door step a lot 
And dispose of the evidence)

(Uhhhhh)

(Wait did you give us the runt?)

(Pet-owning is mostly fine print)

(Well this is going downhill)

(Especially something as smart as a cat
Uhhh
We'll see)

(I would like to point out that your sister chose it)

(Psssh)

(Ryan no
Size doesn't matter)

(Personality does)

(I need that big pussy)

(And your kitten has a great one)

(Thicccc)

(Ew)

(I'm sorry)

(Never went that again)

(The setup was there)

(*send)

(Yeah it's for the best)

(I don't think that's how you describe them😂
I'm glad we won't be talking when I retrieve you)

(I'll bring stumpy)

(Really?)

(Please do)

(So you can get used to posing like a super villain with your cat 😂)

(Of all the kittens, I want you to bring her)

(Really?)

(Of course)

(Haha careful what you wish for)

(I sure hope I'm not allergic)

(Maybe I will)

(😂 I have no idea)

(Oh god)

(I'll try)

(Do not ruin this
Think of your family
Think of stumpy
She needs a home)

(To change my genetic predisposition
Haha I'm pretty sure I'm good though
Don't worry)

(People adapt all the time)

(Pretty sure that's not how it works)

(You can do this)

(Pretty sure everyone is full of stem cells that can be anything at all)

(The pussy?)

(Just keep your eyes on the prize)

(Haha I'm sorry
Not really)

(Not really?!)

(Dammit)

(Excuse you)

(My phones at 6%)

(Ryan Jacobs doesn't have a portable charger?! 😱)

(It's upstairs)

(I'm lazy)

(Way to ignore my disgruntled remarks)

(Cat lady)

(Oh well
Guess I have to talk to my cats
All nine of them)

(*crazy cat lady)

(Ooh got em)

(Ugh why am I still up)

(Ugh why are you texting me?)

(Haha maybe a little 😂)

(😂 haha
Excitement keeping you up?)

(It's weird. I'm a tiny bit nervous to see you again)

(I actually kinda am too 😂)

(I'll teach you all over again haha)

(It feels like forever
I feel like I cant remember how to kiss 
So you'll probably get but again 
Lo siento 
*bit)

(And maybe we won't skip steps this time)

(We always seem to jump ahead)

(It'll be like deja vu)

(Don't worry, I'm a quick learner)

(It'll be like the first time)

(Hahaha)

(Like it never did before
Like the very first time
Like it never will agaiiiinnnnnnnn)

(Just break out into song why don't you)

(It's an awful habit 😂)

(Aww how cute)

(Stumpy seems to be enjoying it though
My melodious voice is just enchanting)

(I can believe it)

(Ha)

(Mollie my back is sunburnt, I'm way darker, and have more acne than typical)

(I hope you won't mind)

(Ooh. Dark and mysterious)

(...but I'm more "culturally aware" soo)

(Soooo almost on my level?)

(Wait that's a thing)

(Ryan, my tan lines are way worse, I can't remember how to do makeup, and I lowkey lost my abs but possible gained some boobs 😐 
I hope you won't mind
Oh wait 
No that was from my period probably
God dammit)

(?)

(Yeah son)

(Also I don't care for makeup soo)

(Yeesh you're not that much more aware)

(Hey I gave my warning too)

(You might after you see me
I'm giving fair warning 😂)

(And I'm probably gonna be sunburnt from here until the end of our fling)

(And apparently I do snore when sleeping in awkward positions)

(Just so you know)

(You doooooo)

(Yeah that makes sense)

(Whitie)

(The snapsssss)

(That beanbag was slanted)

(Hahaha
At least I don't snore
😂)

(You have no idea if I snore in bed)

(You snore in the car)

(Yeah that was a weird position)

(And Felix has a slight ridge but I'd hardly call that a slant)

(Haha)

(😂
Was it?
I honestly can't remember, the snoring was captivating 
Haha
Just being close o another human being was weird 
*to)

(Listening to someone snore counts as being close to them?
Girl you have weird standards)

(Physically you dummy)

(I fit you)

(And push for them
*you fit them
You must be weird)

(😂)

(Like a glove)

(Mmm)

(😂)

(Idk though it's been awhile)

(Are you being serious? 😂)

(There might need to be some readjusting)

(I really don't know)

(Haha well don't worry too much)

(😂 at this point I would say I know the least about what's going on downtown)

(I've got the jeans
Oh and wait one sec)

(*genes)

(Mmm hmm)

(The smart ones 
That help you problem solve these things)

((Racist))

(I made no direct allusions)

(Watson)

(That could come from either side of your family
You assume my dear)

(Nah
I'm all hard work)

(Lucky me)

(￼)

(I was curious)

(What the hell is this)

(Yeah it does feel a little weird haha)

(Oh god
Wait here
I almost feel violated reading this
Though it is helpful
Almost weird that you're looking my stuff up 😂
But nice to know I guess)

(I'm sorry
I just get curious sometimes)

(😂 is this what you do now that you don't jack off)

(Idk first hit on google I think)

(What is this site 😂)

("Why do I have to pee"
Haha or something like that)

(Is that what you typed or is that info for the quote book? 😂)

(Haha that's what I typed)

(Haha it's going there anyways)

(But it should go in there haha)

(I'm glad you used "I")

(For you at least)

(😂 haha)

(When I get the pee feeling, it typically means I have to go)

(Wait that happens to you?)

(Well it's from your perspective. I wanted accurate results)

(Nononono
I meant it means I have to go pee
Like there's no confusion at all)

(Goals)

(Whatsoever between either)

(Haha you used first person for a more accurate google result 😂)

(Cmon I'm a smart guy)

(Ryan Jacobs)

(Arguably)

(Ehhhh)

(Wtf is that)

(By the schools standards
Perhaps
😏😂
Dammit it deleted my picture!
Wait 

Perhaps
😏😏😏
There)

(It's Otis)

(Is that a pig?)

(The cow)

(Uhhh)

(OTIS THE COW)

(Nope)

(😑)

(Yeah I'm drawing a blank here)

(That's what he says
He's Internet famous
Otis 
Says
"Perhaps"
Once again, culture is lost on you
😫)

(Whoops)

(You're not drawing anything)

(Hang on I vaguely remember this show)

(I'm drawing Otis
Hmmmm
^^^^disgruntled)

(I'm reading the Wikipedia)

(Awww)

(Mmm hmm)

(You looked it up
❤️❤️❤️
What a smarty pants)

(So I very very faintly remember the characters but that's it
Just their name
Names)

(You only need to know Otis)

(Nope)

(Sorry)

(I am willing to overlook this transgression)

(Mmm hmm)

(In exchange for your services 
Should I ever need them)

(Tech
Or otherwise)

(Oh that's right I forgot you could do that too)

(Mmm so ambiguous)

(Excellent)

(Nice
Just how I like my women)

(Ambiguous?)

(One for the quote book I see)

(😂
"Possibly a woman…"
Thanks 😂👌)

(Correctamundo)

(Haha who the hell draws with their thumbs?)

(I'm glad you're keeping Otis
That was very hard to accomplish with these thumbs)

(You're doing it wrong)

(Fine)

(Ah a competition I see)

(You draw something then
We both draw something 
Me with thumbs, you, your dumb way)

(See what's better)

(💁)

(Impress
Me
Go)

(Dammit
I don't know what the subject is)

(No hay)

(I sent that emoji to be the subject)

(But okay
What are we drawing?)

(Counting creativity as a category)

(Ewww)

(Uhhhh
Let's see
Mouse
The maggot one
Go)

(Go go go)

(Dammit
I thought that was your drawing so I panic sent)

(Uh I'm not sure)

(Hahaha

What is that 😂😂😂😂
Why is yours blue?
And has laser vision?)

(I tried doing whiskers but I missed)

(It looks like angry eyes 😂)

(Was there an undo button?)

(Ooh
You missed?)

(Even using your superior method?)

(Hahaha)

(Idk
Haha)

(Mollie wouldn't need to know if there was an undo button)

(Precisely 💁)

(Uhhh)

(Alright then
Were there any winners?)

(I'm pretty sure we both lost)

(I'm willing to agree to your terms)

(Oh haha)

(We should have made this higher stakes)

(I should tell you about a bet I made)

(Yesss)

(Balls VS Blocks by Voodoo)

(Let's hear)

(https://appsto.re/us/N2vIjb.i
It's between Scott and I
Whoever gets the highest score by the end of the Europe trip wins
And the stakes are...
A steak dinner)

(Oohhhhh)

(Yeah there's some weird rules we worked out for that)

(Wait
Scott's trip is longer than yours
He's still got England and Iceland)

(Basically I suck
And I have a huge handicap
If I win, I get two stakes, one for a friend
If he wins, I buy him one steak)

(Steaks)

(Whatever)

(Hahaha)

(Haha you don't know that)

(Soooo
You're not going to win)

(I have an 11 hour flight)

(And a penchant for napping)

(Nah)

(I'm promised myself I wouldn't nap
So the jet lag won't hit me)

(So that you'd be nice and exhausted for me)

(Mmm)

(Perfect)

(Who doesn't love a sleepy boy)

(You better get on my good side if you want my other steak dinner)

(Then we really won't talk
Good)

(I'll do so thing for you)

(Uh what)

(*something
Hey Ryan
Wanna know what's even better than eating lemons?
Eating limesssss
Mmmmmm
My mouth is alive)

(Are you eating a lime rn?)

(Yeee)

(Haha nice)

(Papa made margaritas 
I get the leftovers 
Haha
Adulthood here I come)

(I hate cocktails)

(Too sweet for someone as bitter as you?)

(Sweet and bitter complement each other)

(No wonder we get along)

(Um so I guess my postcard got lost haha)

(I was gonna say we're both bitter)

(Oh)

(Oh really?!)

(Well I take it back then)

(We're like constructive interference)

(Did you get it?)

(Building each other up
Wait what's this postcard business?)

(No?)

(Yeah I thought so)

(Did you have my address?
Ryan it could take longer)

(I guess so)

(What did you write?)

(Yup)

(9662 Cripple Creek Ln)

(Fine
I'll just wait
It's out there somewhere)

(Me too)

(And some postman is getting a kick out of it)

(Aw
Traveling to reach me)

(I'm burning up)

(Nah that one is gone forever)

(To know what artsy metaphors Ryan left in his postcard
Or maybe it was just awkward Ryan writing
Knowing my parents would see it)

(Buried in a landfill near the Italian coast
Well at least I'm the bright side, you're parents won't intercept
it
Or they might still
Doesn't matter though. It's relatively tame
Ugh, *on the bright side
Ughghh, *your parents)

(Ughghgh)

(Yeah they'll be like "Woah look at this kid's handwriting. He's pretty cool")

(Haha
Buried off the Italian coast
Poetry for the birds
Aw
I'm sure they'll love it
Maybe dad won't feel so awkward around you then)

(It looks just like joes)

(Hey watch it there)

(They'll be so excited
Haha
Ryan they won't even be able to read it 😂
I'll be lucky to)

(It's "sophisticated")

(More on the side of "troubled genius")

(I found out what time I land)

(Ugh 10:30
Well Mollie, I'll definitely be in Loomis by midnight easily
I'd love it if you could pick me up, but it's understandable if you can't. It'd be kinda cool to see each other again for the first time at night - I don't know why
Anyways I'm boarding right now, so the wifi's gonna peter out within the hour)

(Haha)

(Just landed 😩)

(Cuz we'd both look cuter at night
I'll try to make it work
Haha)

(Home 😄)

(Welcome back to the land of the free 🎉🙏)

(11:30 I think)

(Sooo
What's your ETA?)

(Hopefully that's not too late for you haha
I'm so happy to be back)

(I'll persevere for you)

(Yess)

(I'm sooo happy you're back)

(I just want to find you and kiss you
Right now)

(I want that too)

(Same I'm kinda excited)

(Sooo much
But I might bite you
Ngl it feels like forever ago and I think I forgot Ryan
Be ready for anything
Also
Where exactly am I to retrieve you from?)

(Hahaha)

(It'll feel like the first time a bit)

(Uh one sec
It's on Val verde, so pretty close to you)

(Exactly)

(Also why do you need to get up at 7:00 tomorrow? Like how bad should I be feeling for you right now haha?)

(Sweet
Less waiting time
Also less time to drive around and get hyped 
Sweet
Oh yeah
So
Stumpy?)

(It's not like you would sleep well anyways tho)

(Heyyy)

(Yes please)

(Actually)

(Tuns out I've got till like 10 to leave)

(Ohh nice)

(For Tahoe)

(So I'm set to jet)

(I'm done with that expression)

(And I've started napping well)

(Nice)

(So I'm even more set to jet)

(Learn from the best)

(Mollie guess what)

(💁 look at the better person you're making me)

(I'm wearing my glasses right now)

(What)

(Snap)

(Probably gonna take them off)

(Snap)

(Maybe)

(Pics or it didn't happen)

(Ugh no)

(No
Ryan
Wear them
Wear them tonight
Please
I love glasses
They're so hot)

(They're not
I guess that's subjective
But whatever
I might do it
Just for you)

(I can't even explain how deeply I feel about them)

(Woah there)

(Please
I'll do whatever you want if you wear the glasses
And if you don't
I'll get someone else to take a pic of you with them)

(I didn't actually mean anything nasty by that)

(Whatever I want hmm)

(But whatever 😂)

(Sure)

(Haha nice)

(I have till 10 to sleep
😂)

(I'll try to get you home at a reasonable hour 😂
I just want to start driving soon)

(Uh huh like you always do 👌)

(Haha that emoji)

(*😂
You'll be a bad Asian driver for like two days after this long)

(Huh a bad Asian driver? That must be even worse than a normal Asian driver)

(Hahaha)

(Uhh)

(You know just what I'm thinking)

(I'm in line for customs and the line looks long)

(Soooo)

(Yeah idk)

(12)

(It seems to be moving fast
I'll just send you a text when I get in the car
Dammit
I really wanted to see you tonight. It was gonna be so special and magical)

(It can still be magical and special at like 1 am)

(Alright well we'll pray)

(Just a little sleepier
Look
Everyone here is going to be asleep very soon
And I said I was going
Soooo I'll just sneak
If you still want me to)

(I'm still hoping for the best
You can sleep on your way to Tahoe
That's at least an hour
Yess mollie please)

(Haha then don't worry about it)

(You bought mentos 😂)

(I have enough mentos here to keep me up for another day at least)

(Maybe)

(Haha that's the way to do it)

(Perhaps
I live my life based on hope, not fear 
😂)

(How long are you in Tahoe for?)

(Just the day)

(Sorry my coverage is spotty in here)

(I don't suppose you've reached the car have you?
Also do I have to walk in?
I will
I just need to know if a bra is mandatory or not)

(Uhhhh
What?
Mollie don't give in
Don't you dare fall asleep)

(No it's ok)

(On my way)

(I got myself some ice cream
I'll watch some adult swim 
I'm here
Where are you?)

(Still up?
Mollie get up
You better not bail on me
Mmmollliiieee
You're my ride home)

(Up)

(Uhhhhh)

(Still up
Close?)

(A little less than half an hour
Did you fall asleep?)

(Uhhh)

(I just need to know if I need to wake my parents up for a ride)

(Maybe)

(But I have a stop watch)

(They're asleep and assuming I have a ride home)

(I'm committed)

(Just put the petal to the metal)

(Yeah I would if I could)

(What's the stop watch for?
And also are you feeling okay?
I kinda feel terrible for doing this to you)

(It's ok. It's kinda interesting)

(Haha well then you're definitely feeling it 😂)

(Haha
I meant alarm)

(Yeah I want to tell you about a book I read on my flight about things like this
It was really good)

(Perfect)

(About the point of life and God and things like that)

(Also
Text me when you're like 10 min away)

(Yeah alright)

(Woah)

(Uh one sec)

(What's it called?)

(But as of right now, definitely in my top 3 favorite books of all time)

(Holy crap I wanna read this thing)

(￼)

(Hmmm)

(That sounds so good)

(It was a super easy read too)

(Maybe it's the sleep deprivation talking 
😂)

(Aw perfect for me)

(I did the whole thing start to finish on the plane)

(Haha)

(*the eleven hour plane)

(Okay...)

(Well I did it in about five
Anyways it's about a writer who's trying to figure out what makes a good story
And what makes a good life
Anyways...
I'm ten away)

(Praise the lord)

(*13 minutes)

(Here's hoping I et away clean then ✌️)

(It'll make a good story)

(Down the road)

(Good luck)

(So far no angry calls 
But idk how I'm getting in 😂)

(Getting in?)

(Back in my house without getting caught)

(To your home?)

(Max is too good at his job)

(Oh yeah)

(Good luck
Okay we're two minutes away. See you soon)

(Just very narrowly avoided catastrophe)

(Mollie I got the talk haha)

(Finally)

(What)

(Haha I'll tell you later in person or on the phone)

(WHAT
tell me)

(It's too good and I don't want to butcher it
But let's just say they offered me free condoms... haha 😂)

(Ohhhhh myyyyyy god)

(Yeah I guess)

(😂😂😂😂 nooooo 
Haha. I guess that's the best response we could've hoped for?)

(But they still don't know that we've done it before
He just said "if it ever comes to that we want you to be safe"
Then he went into too much detail)

(Wait. So they don't know it happened?)

(Ugh yeah I'll tell you more later)

(Nooooo hahaha)

(But at one point he said "your mom and I have extra because we use them on the RV trip"
Ughghghh
No)

(NO)

(Hahaha you got caught too. How was the chat?)

(NO NO
NO)

(I didn't get The Chat)

(Oh I thought you said you did)

(Just some confused mumbling about "did you just get home" "what time is it" "go to sleep")

(Oh nice)

(No haha)

(I think he heard the car)

(Wait hold back one sec)

(Damn Felix too powerful)

(Sorry for not asking earlier
Who's Felix?
Sorry 😂)

(Felix?!)

(Is that your other dog?)

(FELIX JOHNSON
FJ)

(Not Sam
The one I feel like I almost kill every time)

(FJ)

(That's your car)

(also)

(Duh)

(Wait nvm)

(How many hours can you go without sleep? I'm going on like 30)

(Mom wanted to talk dentistry alllll the way here)

(Haha riveting)

(I slipped into a three hour nap just now
And I feel pretty good now - just woke up
Dammit)

(Haha nice audio)

(Yeah I remember that thing)

(Oh. I forgot. Lucas wanted me to invite you to his birthday up in Tahoe)

(When is it?)

(Uhhhh one sec)

(Oh that's in like 10 days)

(It's the 27
I think it's a Tuesday
I'll add you to the group chat if you can)

(If you can?)

(That's the plan)

(Oh I see)

(Sooo you definitely should)

(Hmm let me see if I can pencil that in
Yeah of course I'll go)

(YESSS)

(Hmmm?)

(Ryan why do you keep doing that)

(I don't know what you're talking about mollie)

(Typing when I do!)

(Hmm I think that one's up to you)

(Ok
Nvm
Rn everyone's deciding is we should spend the night or not at Tahoe. So if you have any strong feelings feel free to share)

(Just do whatever you think would be fun
Idk what the occasion is)

(Well it's his birthday 😂)

(Oh damn)

(Then do what he wants haha
And tell him I said happy birthday)

(😂 you do it)

(Look there's my card)

(I can probably make anything work so whatever you want to do is fine with me





Yup)

(Ryan)

(Yeah okay)

(It's Lucas 
Lucas)

(😂 is that card for my dad)

(Oh yeah I might have to start working hours soon)

(I will tell him out send his regards I guess
Join the club
I think logistically spending the night might be easier cuz then when everyone's tired we don't have to drive home, plus nights are fun. But it depends on people's work schedules I think)

(Ayyy join the club)

(Uh independent haha)

(Haha where?)

(Oh. For your ranch friend?)

(I'm just going to put in a solid 5-6 hours of work per weekday)

(Then I'm free
Um that too
Honestly I have so many people lined up)

(Jealous)

(I'm just going to try making something myself too and do that on the side)

(😂 why are you even going to college Ryan)

(Hopefully sustain my party lifestyle)

(Hey, sounds like you don't need to sustain it all yourself, the party hats are on your parents 🎉😂)

(College for the connections of course (and LA parties))

(Yeah apparently
Ugh there's so much more to that story, but I'll end up butchering it over text)

(Can you call very fast?)

(You can wait)

(Like two minute story
Otherwise it won't happen until probably late tonight)

(Uhhh)

(How's your fat lip and body?)

(UGHHHHH
you tease)

(Anything noticeable?)

(Lip is still fat. Kinda looks on purpose 😂)

(Hahaha)

(Body not too bad from what I've seen but my back is bruised again
But I can play it off)

(I slipped and fell
And the doorknob hit me in the eye
I swear)

(They'd  believe it 😂)

(￼)

(Wait I never showed you Scott's phone flips
￼
Wait who's number is that? The 9586 one)

(I PUKED A LITTLE IN MY MOUTH)

(Yeah idk who that is)

(Lily burns?)

(And that phone flip is like one of three or four 😂
He almost dropped it that time. Notice how it doesn't land flat in his hand)

(I'm sweating)

(Mmm pale with freckles)

(Jesus Christ scott is the most dangerous human being I know
Lily burns is pale with freckles and long like black hair
Really sweet)

(Oh I guess I'll meet her soon. She was a senior with us?)

(Mmmm)

(What time are you getting back?)

(Indeed
She sweet. Pretty funny
When do him and Noah get back?
I'll see)

(Uhhh)

(Maybe 2:00 😂)

(8:30?
Maybe 9?)

(Sounds like we're finishing our food and bouncing)

(Okay well I don't even know what we'd do. But you're welcome to hang out and eat candy and see all of my new European swag)

(We can eat candy and cuddle and wrestle and watch videos)

(That does sound pretty nice)

(Ok)

(Mollie don't rush)

(Dad thinks he can get us home by 9…
We'll see)

(It's fine
Don't put pressure on your family. It's Father's Day
Like we have so much time together in these next few weeks)

(Awww)

(Same)

(I know
I just want to see you 😂)

(And you know actually do something that's uhh)

(Yeahhhhh)

(Haha parental guidance
Psssh)

(Never had any of that 🙄)

(Oh hey)

(Check your phone dammit)

(Did you get my other texts?)

(Yup)

(?)

(Um one sec)

(Mom isn't home yet, so if I'm gonna run I need to probably do it in like the next 10-20 min
Too late?)

(Yeah you're all good
I'm a little tired
But I still want to see you...)

(Mixed messages)

(Do it)

(Ok ok)

(Come over now)

(Lemme see)

(Wait what happened?)

(Well
Not awful. Not too good though)

(Dad was fine. Mom…)

(Can you talk on the phone?)

(Hopefully she'll get over it)

(I'm getting in the shower)

(I'm just curious)

(Wait why?)

(I want more details)

(It's not awful. But maybe you should come by here sometime to hang out)

(Okay sure)

(As a show of good faith)

(We might have a little sucking up to do)

(But I don't see what went wrong. It was literally dinner with my family)

(Yeah)

(Oh)

(She's just huffy cuz she wants to show me off to her office tomorrow
It's fine)

(Okay you should probably sleep asap haha
Need that beauty rest)

(She's just very stressed and has a lot going on and my comings and goings are an easy target)

(Yeah alright good night)

(Yep
💁👸 not like I'm not already perfect buttttttt
Haha alright
Goodnight then)

(Soo hmm
When)

(I'm free as long as it's not too late)

(That's a smart idea)

(I'll provide mentos)

(💁)

(Uh pick me up at 5:00?)

(When do you want to?)

(Sure)

(Uh back)

(Which door am I supposed to use?
Quickly I'm melting
Holy)

(In the porch
I'm coming down stairs rn)

(Dining room?)

(Mollie help)

(I'm being roasted
￼)

(You came o the right place son)

(Seems like you have a lot of experience with this)

(Tell them there was no mix up, you just had a better thing to do 
You can't act phased 
Just stay cool)

(Get roasted much?)

(No)

(Well I sent it and it definitely triggered a response)

(I roast a lot 
Sometimes it just goes above your head…)

(Let me see)

(￼)

(I want to see my work)

(THATS HOW ITS DONEEEEEE)

(Uh huh)

(🕎 is right
You're welcome)

(Thanks thoug
*though
That was a pretty good comeback)

(I AM a thug)

(Mmm hmm)

(💁 I know it
That's the kinda comeback I'll have when we wrestle 
You won wings but that was stupid anyways 
I'll have my day)

(Keep saying that girl)

(ILL HAVE MY DAY)

(Mollie come run with me tomorrow morning)

(Ryan)

(Uh 6:30 to 7:30)

(I have work
😭 Jesus Christ
Wait 
When)

(The run?)

(Haha it's okay)

(Uhhhhh
Shoot)

(Actually I might be able to do that)

(Don't do it if it's tight)

(But I'd have to leave at like 7:15
That sounds nasty though)

(There will be more running opportunities in the future)

(Hopefully after the heatwave? 😂)

(Haha can't help it)

(Don't get fast again without me 
That'll ruin the future 😂)

(Sorry
I'm a natural
What's your work schedule?)

(Hell if I know)

(How do you not know?)

(Uhhh
Until 6:30 tomorrow I think?)

(Omg you work so much)

(Yeah)

(Is this gonna be a daily thing each week?)

(It's awful)

(Aww)

(No 
I refuse
I literally just get starving and have to be nice
And I can't nap
Or sing
Or talk loud
And im lonely)

(Jesus Christ)

(That last one tho)

(My lord and savior?)

(Surrounded by people and feeling alone)

(Ok let's stop here)

(Aw Mollie no)

(I'm barely staying above the waves let's keep it there)

(It's okay
Sorry for triggering
Hopefully I'll see you tomorrow)

(God I hope so)

(Mmm)

(😂 maybe you can get stumpy
The I have to come visit her
*then
Don't get too tired at your all nighter)

(I gotta get up early tomorrow too
"get up" 😂
That's if I sleep)

(SLEEP)

(Anyways I need to drive. I've just been sitting in the Raley's parking lot)

(Unless you want to group nap tomorrow)

(It's a decent parking lot - not my favorite tomorrow)

(I fantasized a lot about that today 😂)

(*co-nap)

(Really?)

(Yes)

(The target thing specifically?)

(I was so tired
And cold)

(Oh nvm
The nap)

(Napping god)

(😂)

(I was gonna say)

(😂 I see where your mind goes)

(Nononono)

(I was surprised by you
I was gonna say you should be satisfied for *at least* a day)

(You don't know me)

(I really want to nap one of these times)

(Haha)

(We never do that)

(Tomorrow might be your lucky day 😂)

(I sure hope so)

(Okay driving now)

(Have fun, chunky)

(Double hmpf?)

(😂😘
Hmpf)

(I just died)

(I wanted to be sure you saw it)

(Mmm)

(I suck at smash)

(I think you're fine. There's a learning curve and that's totally normal)

(Oh gosh)

(Not everyone can be good at everything. The hand stuff is great)

(😱 oh gosh)

(Those hands are so disproportionately small)

(🤗)

(Like someone else I know)

(What)

(I don't know I'm tired and my memories are all kinda blurry and distorted)

(Why are you up?)

(Don't worry about it)

(Don't you have a bed time?)

(Cuz of you)

(Like a small child would)

(Shuttup I'm leaving you alone)

(Really?)

(How)

(I'm cute)

(Mmmm)

(Like a small child)

(Nothing gets me going more than pedophilia)

(🤗 socks)

(Indeed)

(Mmm
Ok
Indeed sleep)

(Don't send me anymore sad things I have an 11 hour shift and I can't take it)

(Alright)

(Indeed)

(See you tomorrow
Hopefully)

(Perhaps)

(Aww)

(Goodnight)

(You aborted your drawing
Dammit mollie)

(Alrighty. I am officially off. Do you guys want the cat orrrrr?)

(Yeeee)

(Wut)

(But yeah my sister wants to come visit / pick up the cat)

(Idk how taking it works
Like do we just bring it home?)

(Wait)

(Hang on)

(First are you guys ready?
Do you have a box o put it in?)

(Or cat litter? (Id start it on that) or food)

(I really need to shower)

(Ok ok)

(I'm going to overheat)

(Get clean)

(That's the plan)

(Take a cold shower 😂)

(Okay I'll be back in like 15
Okay I'm done
What do we need?
My sister is so hyped. She really wants to bring it home)

(Alright. Kitten food, I'd grab like a box to put her in, maybe stick and old blanket in there for her, I'd get a litter box and litter, or just a normal box that you can put litter in, at least until she's big enough to do everything outside (she's still kinda learning))

(Okay I can get with that last one)

(Just have an inside place to keep her at night so she doesn't get eaten cuz she's still so small
And you have to play with her a lot still because she's not used to being on her own yet and she'll get depressed)

(Um can we borrow a day's worth of food?)

(Yeah and probably litter)

(Frick mollie)

(Let me double check that papa bought more)

(Can you be any slower?)

(What)

(Well my sister wants her rn)

(Oh you mean what?
*wait
Yeah
Idk if papa bought more or not he's not responding 
When do you want her?)

(And honestly I just want to see you
But whatever haha)

(We can do this any way you want 😂)

(Okay well we have an amazon box...)

(Will that work?)

(Yeah literally any old box)

(Right that makes sense)

(If it's for litter then if line it with a trash bad
*bag)

(I'll let her know)

(Ok)

(Okay so all we need is this box?)

(Sure)

(And we're good...)

(I mean. I would make one for litter and one for sleeping)

(Oh okay)

(Just cuz that's what she knows)

(But yeah)

(Well we have more)

(And you can just feed her out of any little bowl or old dish or whatever)

(😂 alright)

(And I'll give you a mouse and a ping pin bowl so she has some tits
*toys
Oops)

(Okay so everything sounds good)

(I guess so)

(I guess)

(Soooo are you gonna come then?)

(Yeah that's what I'm thinking)

(See you in ten?)

(Sure)

(Yeah please do)

(I'll go make sure everyone is clothed 😂)

(I don't want culture shock)

(Please)

(And so are the Jacobs)

(The harmons are beautiful people 💁)

(But we don't flaunt that about)

(Maybe one of them)

(Pssh)

(Haha)

(Okay my sister is getting antsy
Driving over rn)

(Ok)

(Here)

(Your sister knows where they are)

(Okay well come help us pack up)

(Come up
Yes)

(Is stumpy alive?)

(Haha yeah. I'm pretty sure Amanda spent the night in the garage too)

(Good to see someone so listening to my instructions)

(Hmm I'll try that after I run or something)

(😂 go see her once you're all sweaty and she'll like you more)

(Just for kicks)

(Right right)

(What?)

(My because you want her to like you)

(Grammar mollie)

(*not)

(Mmm)

(Dammit
Rough day)

(I'm not a suck up though)

(Haha)

(Mmm hmm)

(You'll win her over with respect
Right, cuz that'll work
Salty, sweaty respect)

(I know that technique already)

(Ew)

(So how was your mom last night?)

(Haha
Not that one
Please)

(Eh)

(Alright well indifferent is better than negative opinions)

(Mostly asleep on the couch
Didn't ask about you so idk
But she's still giving me these long ass shifts soooo
And I don't get lunch done I'm spending it at Susan's 😭😂
So so I guess
Don't worry about it)

(Well I should probably get back to my "work"
See you later)

(Maybe. Pfft whatever.)

(Omg I just found an amazing date spot in auburn)

(Mollie this cat is adorable
It's so cute
And not volatile
And it's tail
Omg it's tail
Okay I'm done)

(I knowwwwwe)

(Yeah I want to go running and get absolutely drenched and see what happens)

(Awww 
Play with her Ryan she needs love and attention 
Let her lick you and she'll like you more I swear)

(I'm almost feeling threatened 😂)

(Mmm hmm I'm think this kitten might be more loving)

(What?!)

(Oh gosh was it really that bad 😂)

(More loving?! 
Would that kitten go down on you even after knowing you haven't showered in four days?!!!
More loving my ass
A friendly tip for the gentlemen.(0:13)
https://9gag.com/gag/a6VmYnL?ref=ios.s.sms
Since apparently you can't do this)

(Sorry 🙄)

(I don't know which thing you're referring to but yes)

(Yeah and I can't tie a tie)

(That too)

(Even I can tie a tie)

(They also thought you were a lesbian)

(Who?!)

(Keep telling yourself that)

(Oh 
Right
Tomboy is very chic
I was cool)

(Only a cool kid could've pulled off that hair)

(I know I know)

(And that's why it never worked
Damn I'm on a roll 🔥)

(One)

(I had at least two right there)

(One is not a roll
I feel sad for you
Cmon math boy. Step it up)

(Maybe even three
Nvm
I'm not counting)

(You're not supposed to keep track in relationships ryan)

(Ha)

(Get with it 
😂 ha)

(I don't like the way it looks when the emoji is big)

(Yeah same 😂)

(😂 so I always add that)

(I always add something so it doesn't get big)

(😂 ha)

(So ummm)

(Synced as always)

(Hey Mollie...
I know I don't talk to you much
But if you know
You're not doing anything
Maybe would you...
Uh crap
Nvm)

(Crap?)

(Uh bail bail)

(That's kinda kinky…)

(Abort mission)

(NONONO)

(Oh screw it)

(LOCK ON TARGET
COMPLETE MISSION OR DIE TRYING)

(Mollie would you go on a date with me?)

(Oh gosh)

(😂)

(Ryan, I've honestly always thought that you kinda hated me
You know what? Sure. As long as there's no strings attached, I'd lie to go on a date 
*love)

(Of course you'd lie)

(💁 obviously)

(Mmm movies)

(Really? I didn't take you for a movie kind of guy)

(Haha yeah you know me)

(Seems like you'd want to be able to talk)

(The talkative one)

(Such a brazen, outgoing lad that jacobs boy)

(Mmm brazen)

(Personally I'd go with boisterous)

(Rowdy delinquent)

(But seriously)

(Yay or nay)

(Yaya)

(Hmm okay)

(I wasn't expecting that)

(A yay?)

(Where are you rn?)

(I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt)

(I wanna go to that place in auburn)

(Sitting on my trampoline questioning why I left my house)

(Yeah)

(Oh
That place?)

(There's a really cool coffee shop right there
It's super hipstery
Probably the most I've seen)

(Wait really?)

(Not that I'd be into that)

(Hipster?)

(😂 should I dress for the occasion?)

(Uh yeah red flannel and blue jeans)

(Right right)

(High waisted tho)

(I have something even better)

(And black rimmed glasses)

(And easier to remove)

(Dammit girl)

(Glasses are on you 😂)

(Okay well then)

(Well well well)

(Oh yeah)

(Well?)

(So I could pick you up
Or you drive to me here and we carpool)

(Uhhhh)

(Yeah)

(Wait. We're going to the auburn place?
So I don't need Felix?)

(Unless you wanna stay out later 😂)

(Ooh hot)

(Yeah like just pick you up right?)

(Haha nah
Ok ok
Can you come to me tonight?)

(And should I actually dress for it? 😂)

(The coffee shop?)

(Yeah)

(Nah you're good
I just have to put on a clean shirt)

(😂 same)

(Okay I'll probably leave in 15 min)

(Sorry I got distracted)

(What?)

(I'll show up at 7:30)

(Ok)

(Bring that Barcelona book if you still have it)

(I wanna read it now 😂)

(Yeah!)

(That sounds like a threat 😂)

(And you can say bye to the last of the kittens)

(Well apparently the little buggers are threatening me)

(Mmm hmm)

(Aha
😂 just get over here boy 
If you hurry we can pick something up from Walmart…)

(Okay leaving in 3 min
Here
Mmmmollliiee)

(￼Like this?)

(😂 yeah like that)

(Got it)

(I feel so weird)

(Like now you're putting too much effort in this)

(No no!)

(It might 😂)

(Don't feel weird
😂 idk I just want to try it
Does it really do it that much for you?)

(We'll see
Monday mollie Monday...)

(I knowwwww)

(Alright goodnight)

(Haha ok
I really need to sleep
Until Monday, my Asian lover)

(It's okay to call me whenever too. I'll always pickup some of the time)

(Always some of the time sounds like just the right amount of times)

(Oh and is there a time difference? Just wondering)

(Uhhhh)

(Haha alright good to know)

(An hour?
Idk it's light up there 24/7 rn so I'll be fucked up no matter what)

(Get some sleep then)

(Alrighty 😘)

(Nighty night miss mollie 😘)

(Look up Goose Creek Tower in Alaska)

(Woah)

(That's a little sketchy. Pretty impressive though. Did you see it?)

(I'm)

(Holy shit)

(*um
That's moms attorney
We're gonna be there
With the film crew
It's been a weird few hours)

(That's amazing
I read that it was some attorney
I didn't know it was yours
That's so cool
Please get in the footage somehow 🙏)

(Yep. Mom ended up knowing the right people and we just had dinner w him. He went to MIT then Harvard and he's super eccentric)

(￼)

(Haha that's the plan, obviously 😈💁)

(Literally the words they used 😂
That's so incredibly awesome. I hope you realize that Mollie. Did you guys know this was gonna happen before hand?)

(😂 trust me if you saw him you'd know)

(Yeah online it said that most people don't. Only from air)

(Umm. Mom became friends w him and he took pity on her but we didn't think we'd get to see the tower in person 
I'm so hyped)

(Do you get to go in?)

(Indeed. We get the exclusive tour)

(Haha)

(Haha 
He's trying to marry me off to his grandson 😂
Who's 13)

(Some like em young)

(😂 @ryanmjacobs)

(What?)

(Mollie what are you on about?)

(Likin em young)

(Oh oh got it)

(I thought you found something online about me
I need to fix all that stuff)

(Online stuff?)

(Mmm yeah just don't go digging)

(Ha. Don't get a big head)

(A lot of that stuff is old)

(Digging rn)

(Stop it)

(It's old)

(There's a politician w your name)

(I was younger)

(No one will ever find you)

(And slightly more cocky)

(Like that's possible)

(Dammit)

(FOUND YOU)

(I thought you were done looking)

(I'm never done)

(What site?)

(Not that sure what I found but I found you)

(GitHub)

(Oh yeah all my old projects)

(Before I got afraid of success
But that's another story)

(I'm intrigued)

(Dammit where)

(I found a typo
Ryan
You need to fix it)

(Feel free to submit any ideas, questions, or problems by reporting an issue. Or, if you're feeling bit brave, submit a pull)

(Dammit)

(You forgot an "a" in your contributing script 
Wow. Someone was feeling a bit brace
*brave)

(That's why they did it)

(I'll fix that at some point)

(That damn typo)

(There was a lot)

(Jesus I didn't realize how much of this there was)

(And if you look in the project issues, you can read me arguing with people on how to run my project)

(Hell yeah)

(Mollie please stop looking)

(If you still are)

(Ryan what's on here?)

(Nothing bad)

(Just me when I was younger)

(😂 everyone has that)

(￼)

(I'm so impressed rn I'm kinda nervous to talk to you)

(You're in the commit log now 😂)

(Wait what?!)

(I fixed the typo haha)

(What is that?!)

(Every change to the repository requires a commit. It's called version control
That way if anything breaks, you can revert to an old commit)

(Sooooo)

(https://github.com/ryanmjacobs/c/commits/master)

(I helped make a fix?)

(Click on any of them to see the text delta
(Modification or whatever))

(YAYYYYY)

(Isn't it past your bedtime?)

(I'm immortalized)

(Ok ok I'll leave you alone now)

(That's not what I said)

(Yes but the sun never sets here sooooo)

(But alright 😂)

(Party all night?)

(Literally kids are just out like playing hockey and stuff)

(Just think about how many parties you could throw in that tower...)

(Like at 3 am couples just go on walks)

(Haha that's funny)

(I would be down for that here)

(Same)

(Haha that's a little counterintuitive)

(Honestly it's probably safer down there
The natives are hella sketch up here
And there's literally bears everywhere
Everything can kill you)

(Send me a scenic picture if you can
I wanna see the Alaskan landscape)

(I will. It's like nothing your ever seen)

(Mollie stop it)

(I didn't really think flickr was your speed)

(Too much
I'm sure I could find you too)

(I'm sure you could too)

(Uh I know they used one in Jurassic park)

(Haha I'm sorry I couldn't help it
I'm done I swear
Ryan he's got a bunch of old fancy sat phones and stuff do you know anything about any of those?)

(But that's about it
Idk what you could do with an old one)

(😂omg finally something I know more about than you)

(Hey I'm literally memorizing the Wikipedia page for it rn)

(You can't do much but donate it to an old hunting museum here 😂
God he's a hoarder)

(No no
He's "eccentric")

(Aw my hero ❤️)

(Holy crap)

(Wow so competitive 
😂 right right "eccentric")

(They're like $600 to $1200 each
And cost $6.00/min)

(Yeah I know Ryan)

(So you get to keep them?)

(We've got like 5 or 6 so far that we've found 
I told you. Hoarder)

(You guys should just put them on eBay
You're probably doing that already though)

(Well yeah but I mean they're old as dirt)

(When are you coming back?)

(￼
There's some cool stuff though 
Mom doesn't know how to put stuff on eBay and she's afraid of the unknown)

(Sunday night mdear)

(😂 I don't like m'dear)

(Sorry babe)

(Ugh stop it)

(Noted)

(Right right)

(There we go)

("Asian lover")

(That's the good one yes?)

(Something with more class)

(You can thank papa for coining that one 😂)

(Mmm)

(I guess that one has a double meaning
Now is the lover Asian? Or does this person love Asians?)

(One refers to me)

(Purrfect)

(The other to you
Perfect)

(I'm already off to a great start. Just ate breakfast at 1pm)

(Goals)

(Hahaha no)

(Now going on to stalk your lover through her childhood years)

(I stopped)

(Good)

(So uh)

(As did I)

(We may have missed the boat
For Henry's place)

(Nooooo)

(I found a better place though)

(After all that snap talk was getting me so excited 😭😭😭)

(Really?)

(Uh wait nvm)

(Better than sweet Henry?)

(I might be able to find a better place
I found a couple but they're private rooms
Which means that it's basically a house where they give you a bed/bath but other people still live there)

(Oh)

(Damn but the locations were cool. Like straight up downtown sac)

(Uh)

(That might end up being voyeurism)

(Yeah...)

(Not into that)

(Woah that's awesome)

(No I don't think so haha)

(*as far as you know
Haha family isn't going out of town at all are they? 😂)

(￼
But downtown sac is so cool)

(Ugh)

(Maybe we just splurge and get a hotel)

(We could take romantic walks after 😂)

(I like apartments tho)

(This is what my grad money goes toward 😂)

(Ugh no)

(Boning
Haha ok
Whatever you wanna do boy)

(Don't look at it that way 😂)

(*Doing it for a romantic evening alone so I can feel safe and close with someone I care about)

(Yesss)

(That's what I'm talking about
http://abnb.me/EVmg/h7GHsnyrfE
That place is only $60
And it's an entire house. Look at the pictures)

(Wow that's right next to my
Lake house)

(http://abnb.me/EVmg/yxNR4hUrfE)

(Mmmmm
We could do it all over that place)

(Wait nvm scratch that one too. It's also shared)

(Yeah)

(So do we even know if Monday works?)

(Damn
Ugh looking at these is making me frustrated ryan)

(No)

(Haha damn alright)

(I have to see what the deal is
Sorry)

(I'll try and find out today)

(Well we always could just do it later)

(True I guess)

(Aww)

(Idk. 😂 I really miss you rn so I might not make the best decisions)

(Same
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow night
We'll see)

(Damn that's right)

(Like what time are you getting back?)

(I hope so)

(Uhhh)

(Pssh)

(I think I land at 9:30 😅)

(I landed at 9:30 last time
And it only took one and a half hours for customs
And two hours to drive back
And two and a half hours to mess around in the back of a knock-off keep
*jeep
Sorry Felix)

(Soooo you should be strong enough to wait it out 😂)

(Hmm I'm debating it)

(You just need an excuse)

(What for my family?)

(😂)

(Oh wait. You're family's cool)

(Uh yeah they would be cool with it)

(Crap for min)

(Who's all in AK?)

(Me and mom)

(Oh hmm)

(Yayy)

(Yeah idk if I could pick you up
I might be able to just wave and say hi at the airport 😂)

(UGHHHH)

(And because it's so late...)

(I need more than a wave)

(The auburn house would be open...)

(Trueeeee)

(Nah)

(So if I could get out
And hopefully it wouldn't be so hot)

(It's cooling off
The heatwave will be over by Monday)

(So we can heat it up)

(Mmm)

(Sweet)

(But honestly if you land at 9:30
You'll be out at like 10:00 in Sac
Do you really think your mom would let you free?)

(That's the thing)

("I... uh... I")

(Idk
Papa would 
But an excuse)

("Desperately need to stumpy asap"
"Like right now"
"Or she'll die"
"And no you can't come mom"
*see stumpy
Crap)

(Hey that's not bad 😂)

(Uh yeah)

(God
This is desperation 
So obvious 😂)

(Well maybe if we're a little more upfront
Note, I said a little
Like if I showed up
And we just said we were going to get frozen yogurt and catch up until midnight)

(Ooh)

(Honestly that would be pretty chill anyways)

(Not bad actually)

(But it's a Sunday sooo)

(That might work)

(In-n-out is open till 1:00 on sundays
So milkshakes might be an option
Plus the first thing people do coming back to CA after a while, is go to in-n-out, granted you've only been away for a few days)

(But I need that cali flavor ryan 😂)

(That looks amazing)

(￼)

(I'm a little jealous haha)

(I can't capture it I'm losing my mind)

(Yeah tell me about it)

(There's just nothing like it)

(It's so hard to capture landscapes
They look 10x better in person
And if you have a really expensive camera...
It still looks twice as good in person)

(Nothing beats the human eye)

(Watch it there)

(At least mine
Can't speak for you're 

Yours)

(Someone's feelings are gonna get hurt)

(As long as it's not mine)

(Glad you have your priorities set)

(I take care of myself)

(Mmm self-sufficiency is such a turn on)

(...for some
I like to dominate my women
Haha okay I'm gonna stop)

(I don't mind a little domination)

(Just be glad that I'm not into chains 😂)

(😏 of course, anyone who likes socks wants to be in control...)

(Socks aren't the worst thing when you look at the alternatives)

(I can get behind socks 😏)

(Dammit mollie)

(Damn you're returning the heat tonight 🔥
How exciting)

(I always return the heat
Sometimes it's lukewarm
But the effort is there)

(Aw)

(Nah I swear it's 50% luck)

(The effort 
Effort doesn't get you jack in the real world 😎)

(Okay maybe 30% luck
And 30% smarts)

(Bad luck in my case 😂)

(And 30% hard work)

(And 10% reason to remember the name?)

(YOUUUUUUUU)

(*Ryu)

(Mmmmm)

(And a lil bit of ass)

(So glad I'm sleeping with someone who's got class)

(*sass)

(Yeah girl)

(Mmm
Not just a lil
Haha ok I need to eat)

(Go masticate for me)

(You ruined that for me 😂)

(Haha I don't think you can ruin eating)

(Right)

(Oh right)

(Eating)

(That too)

("That too")

(Wait what?)

(Now I'm lost
See this is what happens when you play with the fire that is double entendres)

(I was just making fun of you 😂)

(Mmm right)

(You should be used to it by now 😏)

(It's getting awfully close to your bedtime mollie
Oh yeah and they cancelled the American graffiti thing)

(If I can't go then no one can 😂)

(Ugh that sounds like so much fun)

(Gosh Ryan I'll leave you alone 😂
But I'll be up all night exploring
Cuz the sun doesn't set here)

(I do like exploring)

(I wish I could bring you up here so bad)

(Honestly I'm surprised you have cell coverage)

(There's just nothing like it Ryan. It's so wild)

(Maybe you can come on our Vancouver trip 😂)

(And disappointed?)

(Canada's almost like AK)

(Wait what?!)

(It's north)

(I am aware)

(Scott and I always wanted to go to Vancouver)

(Wait what is this business)

(It's only a 14 hour drive
So we were gonna get a small group of maybe five or six and book it up north)

(Hell yeah!)

(Yeah let's do it)

(I've always wanted to go)

(So uh not that it's a priority or anything
But the drinking age is 19 up there
When do you leave for good?)

(I thought it was 18!)

(East Canada is mostly 18 😂)

(September 18)

(Let's go there)

(But B.C. is 19)

(I like eastern things)

(Yeah that's a bit far)

(😏)

(Haha
North and east?)

(I actually meant Chinese but that too 😂)

(Well that was a bit of a stretch)

(Cmon)

(Middle?)

(Far East
😑)

(China is Far East)

(Yeah I know)

(Okay let's face it
We're bad at jokes)

(*you're)

(Well hey now)

(Bad at jokes, good at roasts 
Bad at rhyming, bad at timing 
Bad at sex, I don't know what's next)

(Criticize it
And you won't get it again)

(No mo)

(Haha omg)

(*NO NO
NONONO 
Ryan
I was just poking fun at our learning curve 
It's sweet
It's really good now 
Please
It's a funny memory 
Ryan be rational)

(I triggered someone
I know it's a lot better now
Some of the times I don't even need help
😂 some of the times
And it's about to get better if you buy the socks
Just hurry up and get back here
September 18th is perfect though - I think I leave on the 17th)

(One sad night alone)

(Me too)

(With my memories
I'm getting those damn socks
I'm so excited)

(I just bought a dozen hand mirrors)

(Hey now)

(It's okay)

(I feel like that's just enough to see 😂
Any movement would ruin that 
Too much thinking)

(I'm gonna find out a solution
That's what I do best)

(Ryan we don't have to do mine)

(Not dirty?)

(As long as you're into it I am
Just talk to me honestly
😂)

(Just honestly?
"Oh Molliieee, you feel so adequate. Yes yes it's almost good yeah")

(Well then)

(Haha)

(We don't have to do it at all)

(We need to stop with these empty af threats)

("Empty")

(Mmm hmm I know you want it as badly as I do)

(Damn)

(Get some sleep mollie)

(I've given away too much)

(Fine)

(Wait one more question)

(Off to Greece)

(Mmm got it)

(Good timing then. I was thinking you left early august for some reason
We can do it legally for once 😂)

(Aww)

(We'll role play)

(Won't be as hot)

("Mollie pretend like you were 17 again")

(Mmm)

(Hey there's a small gap where we're both 18)

(And you can be 19)

(Finally)

(When's your flight?)

(Let's do it then
We should probably leave earlier so we have the whole day right?)

(Ahora misma)

(Ah well see you on the flip side)

(Ooh good job 😏)

(Yeah I was debating it)

(I'm sure that was courtesy of google translate but at least there was no botching 
*bitching)

(But you realized you adored my sexy command of the language of love and wanted to hear more)

(Pretty sure the language of love is French but whatever)

(Latin based languages mi amigo)

(That's most languages 😂)

(Ok ok)

(Mmm alright I'll roll with it)

(But some are definitely more romantic than others
If there's rolling Rs and yodeling before you take a shot it's a love language)

(Ayy papi)

(Mmm)

(😂let's not)

(So hot
😂 but maybe you should leave the sexy talk to me
At least in Spanish 
Anytime you wanna get going in Chinese though 😏)

(I can only count and ask for milk)

(Mmmm I do like a boy who knows his numbers)

(Haha there we go)

(Haha
And one with strong bones 😂)

(So hmm
What's the plan)

(Idk)

(Dammit)

(The plan Stan is that I'm lifting off fam
Soooo)

(Talk to you in Seattle?)

(Oh you have a layover)

(Unless you wanna talk to my dad 😂)

(9162083233)

(Uh no I'm good)

(Barely
There haha)

(Work it out with the man 😂)

(Sorry)

(Perdedor)

(Ugh)

(We'll see if you end this night solo then)

(Adios mi amor)

(Wait)

(Haha)

(When do you land in Seattle?)

(Ugh)

(Okay)

(*uhh
Three hours?
And fourty min)

(Well text me when you land)

(You got it)

(Dammit no)

(You want sum "stuff"
https://9gag.com/gag/a7D5V1L?ref=ios.s.sms)

(We have the FJ 😂)

(Felix hurts me sometimes)

(Honestly if you just brought a blanket one of these times)

(😂 
Haha ok I'm actually going)

(Alright adios mi amor)

(I ALWAYS DO)

(As it goes)

(😏 adios)

(I literally found out an hour ago)

(So you knew that I found it
Sorry, I was feeling a lil aggressive. 😂)

(💁)

(How long ago was it?)

(Slowpoke)

(Like a day)

(Oh well)

(The night I was stalking you)

(Uh huh)

(Now I can read them too 😊)

(What the tweets?)

(Oh the articles)

(Slowpokeeeee)

(Most of them would go over your head anyways...)

(😘)

(Right. Like everything else in our conversations?)

(Mmm)

(Or like children's riddles and basic literary queues go over yours?
*cues
Shoot)

(So what time do you land in Sac?
I might have a surprise)

(9:30)

(Kinda defeats the purpose doesn't it)

(What?
What?!)

(So the plane lands at 9:30 and you saunter into the lobby when?)

(Uhhhh)

(Nah)

(Like 9:45?
Ryan
What have you done
Is this something I need to warn mother about?)

(Wait)

(Do you normally wear makeup?)

(I forgot I didn't wear makeup
Shit)

(Honestly I don't care mollie)

(Not much but you'll notice 😂)

(No I won't)

(Or not)

(I promise)

(You seem pretty clueless. 😂)

(Looks aren't a priority for me haha)

(Haha)

(I will take of my elderly grandpas jacket for you though)

(Mmm but old people are soooo hot)

(Obviously 😂😭
*off)

(Mmm and that smell of mothballs)

(Mmmm)

(Reaaalllyy gets me going)

(What's your boarding time?)

(6:55)

(Nice)

(Soooo as soon as they let me off this one I'm running)

(I'm running too)

(Finally getting that cardio in)

(￼)

(😂)

(Wow)

(Gotta keep tha booty)

(I didn't expect my legs to look so awkward mid step)

(Oh damn)

(Frick)

(Yeah I'm kinda uncomfortable why are they crossed 😂)

(Stop it)

(You look like a lady prancing 😂)

(Whatever)

(￼
*the "I'm out of shape and need to breathe pose")

(Ooh those muscles!)

(Mmm)

(What a vascular lad 😍)

(Well I'm gonna hop in the shower
Text me when you land)

(You got it)

(Well)

(Holy crap 15 min early)

(I'm here
With the boys)

(What?!)

(Michael and kyle are with me)

(WHAT?!)

(Wanna get milkshakes with us?)

(Wait 
Where is here?
You're here?!
Ryan
What)

(Hey I have service)

(God I'm so nervous)

(Nice job girl)

(Idk what's gonna happen
And I look like I straight died 😂)

(So uh that means that they have no idea what time you slipped in right?)

(I'm willing to consider this one a team effort 😂)

(Yeah that sounds reasonable)

(Hopefully
Sooo
Like 2 sounds ok yeah?
Or is that a push)

(But if it's too early they'll know for sure
Unless you just said you didn't check the clock really)

(Right right)

(It was 2 ish when Michael and kyle left)

(Sooo 2ish but I'm not that sure)

(But yeah what you said
2 ish but not quite sure)

(They hadn't texted for a bit by then so we should be good)

(Yeah please do)

(Ok I think we're fine. I'll see how they feel about you tomorrow
Idk we might have to suck up but I have to figure out how)

(If we burn this bridge, we're not gonna be able to hang out like at all)

(I know I know)

(You managed to win my family's approval by stopping by a couple of times)

(Dammit it's just so hard not to stay out cuz that's the only way to see each other)

(Mmm yeah it does)

(Ughhh
Haha awesome
I'll figure it out. Don't worry, it always works out for us 😂)

(It's weird how that works)

(Let's not look that gift horse in the mouth)

(Goodnight then)

(Ok I need sleep)

(Sleep tight)

(I hope you're doing all right)

(And haven't fallen asleep yet in the office
I feel really bad for keeping you out. Sorry)

(Well, I'm finally on lunch do a bit better 😂)

(Yeah I'll ride with you haha)

(*so
Also. Lucas wants you or at least someone to ride up to Tahoe with me so he can pack stuff in the van
Sorry 😂)

(Ugh mollie
I feel like your family hates me now)

("Hate" seems a bit strong)

(Oh nice)

(It's ok
Just mom gets frustrated with me
She's actually the one who wanted me to get you a gift in Alaska though 😂)

(So uh
Did you do it? 😂
Just kidding it's all good
I think it might be good for me to come over and school you in chess again
In a public area like downstairs or something)

(😂 it's nothin great. I was thinking more of stumpy than of you when I bought it)

(Maybe checkers)

(Yes
I think that's a good idea too)

(Chinese checkers?)

(That's a little more your level)

(That seems unfair)

(Mmm right)

(Oh you did it now
And "schooled" seems like the wrong phrase 
You got lucky
Because I got lazy
It won't happen again)

(We'll see
Wait how long is your lunch?)

(Well. 45 min today)

(Oh wow a whole 45 minutes)

(An hour on good days)

(Lucky)

(Sooo much better than your free living schedule)

(Mmm)

(Ugh, the life of a programmer)

(So hmm
If you pick me up tomorrow and drive me to the park and ride...
That'd be nice)

(🙄)

(😏 ok)

(For you, anything my prince)

(But you might owe me)

(Right right)

(😏 we can discuss terms later)

(Very transactional)

(Quid pro quo)

(Quid pro quo)

(Dammit)

(OHHHHH)

(We'll be Latin bros)

(SYNCED)

(How tired are you?)

(pro sociis tempus?)

(Wtf)

(Uhhh)

(Bad this morning)

(I need translate)

(Latin let's go!)

(Yeah I woke up at 11:30 and I felt a little tired)

(😂 whoops)

("A little tired")

(Before my time I guess)

(I remember those days
Of blissful freedom and no pull of responsibility)

(Ahhhh, sweet childhood)

(Mmm hmm)

(Haha 😂 I guess so
You've made me much better at this all nighter thing though 
Good before college I guess)

(I've been mister miyagi-ing you the whole time)

(Right, that's what you had in mind)

(Speaking of being Asian)

(Typical Asian)

(I have an eye appointment I need to be going to right now)

(They can fix that?!)

(Fix what haha?)

(Oh wait 
Nvm)

(My squinty af eyes?)

Exotic
Bright and curious
And Asian)

(Personality: Asian)

(It's on my drivers license)

(What?!)

(Hair: drk. Brown)

(Personality: Asian)

*arguably 
Taste: arguably above average
💁)

(Hey there)

(Right right😂)

(Okay I need to go now)

(😂 I've literally been leaving you alone)

(Yeah well I'm letting you know haha)

(Ok go get that eye thing fixed 😂)

(😂 afraid I'm too simple to read between the lines?)

(Mmm)

(This chess defeat is gonna hit you hard)

(So maybe text me tonight  when you get off)

(Maybe)

(Haha maybe)

(Maybe we can have some fun before we go to my house)

(What did you have in mind?
Also it turns out I'm not driving)

(Cuz you're Asian?)

(So I've got 20 min until roseville)

(It's ok)

(Yeah that's what I figured)

(I've got like 5
Maybe)

(But are you serious about doing stuff between work and home?
I mean not "stuff" but I need to know what the plan is
Like do I need a car)

(Oh gosh idk)

(Well it's daylight out 😂)

(I have Felix
That's usually easier but it doesn't have to be
Also

(Both is a good compromise I feel like)

(Who's all at your house rn?
Not that it matters that much)

(No one)

(Well that's a little sketchy)

(Idk where everyone is I'll see)

(Yeah idk that'd be a good move on my part)

(Haha no you're fine)

(I don't think they would hate it but idk

(Quality over quantity my friend)

(So do you want to pick up that book with me or are you busy?)

(Uhhh let me check some things)

(Uh maybe we should just do it some other time then)

(I have a little time)

(No I mean I'm free)

(Haha well you literally said a "little time")

(For awhile
Also I'm leaving Friday for a week and a half)

(So this is probably the last time you'll see me)

(Dammit)

(😂 ok ok)

(Ugh)

(Okay um
Let me think for a sec
Okay so I can shove your stuff in my car and drive over. Then we can leave from there
Or do you just wanna meet at Walmart?)

Aw missed opportunity)

(Story of us)

(Whatever maybe I'll do it later when you're not looking)

(😂
Ryan I really wanna see the postcard draft)

(It's killing me)

(Yeah okay)

(Haha)

(I'll use a piece of card stock)

(And you can pretend there's a pretty painting on the front)

(Awwww)

(Wait...)

(Que romantica)

(If I put a stamp on it, would it send?)

(With an address)

(Eh it's probably best to just hand it to you)

(😂 the determination here)

(I tend to lose them in the mail)

(😂 it's that handwriting)

(Honestly I think I should have written your address neater)

(Honestly probably 😂)

(Whatever I learned my lesson)

(Dumb bitch
After all that drafting
It was the address
Smh)

(Maybe
It's bad that I'm still in bed isn't it)

(You are?!)

(Ugh mollie)

(You lucky hit
*shit)

(I don't want to get up
It's so warm right here
Oh fuck
Did they say why you were nauseous?
I mean I think we're good - that'd be a little fast, but you know)

(Oh my god Ryan it's not that this is an ongoing issue for me 😂)

(Oh thank god haha)

(Smhhhhhhh)

(Oh damn that's early)

(The early bird gets the worm)

(So I guess this is it)

(I can't see you again before you leave?
Dammit I'm sorry if that sounds clingy)

(Awww)

(Well now she has herpes too)

(￼
Here. This hot vid can tie you over for those lonely night 😏😉)

(The whole bunch of us)

(What?!)

(Mollie I want to)

(Herpes!
Haha honestly if you wanted to bring that card over you could probably swing by 
But maybe later? Fast? Idk)

(Tell me what the deal is)

(Uhhh. I'm just hanging out with Natalie and Taylor)

(Oh right)

(Making out and stuff)

(They're ok with it)

("Making out")

(They all like you
Otherwise I'll just be making out with taylor)

(I know what I saw
Okay okay if it's alright I'll swing by)

(Haha that was just the warm up)

(Probably 9:45)

(Are you sure they're okay?)

(Yeah it's ok but try to get here soon)

(Here)

(I hope this won't be weird haha)

(Enter)

(Frick)

(Adios cariño. Please don't do anything stupid while I'm gone ❤️
Ryan you didn't stay up all night and get yourself sick again did you?)

(Mollie I'm sorry)

(No ryan)

(Won't happen again I promise)

(Ryan I've heard that before)

(I'm really really sorry)

(Why?)

(Ugh mollie I'm fine)

(Ryan you're scaring me
I thought you were a little better Ryan 
You need to talk to me more, you can't live like this Ryan)

(I don't need help
I'm okay)

(Ok you're not fine)

(Yeah alright)

(Ryan if you were fine you wouldn't do this
It's ok not to be fine, people rarely are
Just let me know, ok?
I really care about you. I want you to have a good life 
I don't want to feel like you're worse off with me)

(I just like you so fucking much. I would jump in front of a bullet to save you. And that scares me. A lot. And I don't know why the hell you keep sticking around. But that's okay. Don't worry about it too much. I'll figure it out - that's what I do best)

(Ryan I'm scared too, but I can't jump in front of the bullet when you're the one pointing the gun. You don't need to know why, I don't even need to know why, but if I wanted to, I would leave. I haven't left ryan.)

(Yeah you're good)

(Just stick with me. It'll be ok
Ryan let me know you're reading this)

(Thanks Mollie
I'm sorry for freaking you out)

(Eh, it's ok, that's what the meds are for babe 😉)

(You keep saying that)

(Just stick with me alright?)

(Yeah I am
All good here)

(I wanna be sure you understand)

(I ran a couple of miles for the first time in like a week and I feel a million times better)

(Just thought you'd like to know
I was really really depressed for the past couple of days. I'm okay talking about it, (well as long as this runner's high keeps up...)
Anyways thanks for caring. I'm sorry if I was pushing you away)

(Dammit why did I have to go to sleep)

(Haha like what?)

(It's ok, I understand, I do the same thing. But I'm here for you, I swear, you can tell me anything
I wanted you to know that Joseph is bragging about you to anyone who'll listen 😂)

(I hope it wasn't that puzzle...)

(😂 he's still so impressed)

(Okay okay)

(Haha "Mollie's boyfriend has the highest GPA in Del oro"
"He's like the smartest kid in town"
"He does computer stuff")

("He played video games with me")

(That's enough 😂)

(He's so funny 😂 he's like enamored with the concept)

(Wow so he's the lucky one)

(Well crap mollie I'm reading some stuff I wrote a couple of days ago
And if I send it to you, promise me you won't freak out)

(I promise)

(Okay I'll send it. Then I'm taking a shower. So I'm going to ignore my phone for a bit, just fyi)

(Alright)

(￼Btw I'm okay now I think)

(Dammit Ryan I'm scared too. I do understand, I'm just scared because I'm not used to seeing anyone else like this. You leaving me before our deadline has been my biggest fear this whole time, and I lay awake every night and worry. I feel so shallow next to you. Like there's so much more depth and humor in you and I'm like an accessory, like you don't even really like me like that but I'm new and a novel distraction. I'm sorry if that hurts. I know it's unreasonable but I can't help it. I know I can't fix you, you have to do that yourself, but I'll be damned if I don't at least try.)

(Well I'm glad we're on the same level haha)

(You don't have to say it by the way. I feel like it's something that you just know, and that's enough to be content. Don't beat yourself up over your misconstrued ideas of what the typical relationship should entail. I know. 
I honestly thought you knew too
I guess I need to work on showing my feelings better
Ryan how were you last night?)

(Don't worry, I won't leave until I have to)

(Me neither)

(Yeah better)

(Ugh 
Thank god
You were better?)

(Like actually?)

(Okay well)

(I still did it
Which is sad
But I'm feeling better)

(Fuck)

(Stop it)

(Ok ok)

(I'm okay)

(I can't help it)

(I'm confused)

(It makes me so nervous 
I don't want you to feel like you have to change)

(Change what?)

(Yourself, your state of mind)

(Nah it's probably good for me)

(I don't know
It just scares me
But I have faith
I know you're a good kid)

(No)

(Yes)

(Because people don't change)

(It's fine)

(Not really)

(People change all the time)

(You're perfect the way you are)

(Yeah okay)

(But this is something deeper
Your fundamentals don't change
How you handle them does
Look, just take care of yourself
As much as you can
Please
You need to hang it with stumpy more
*out)

(Mollie I'll be fine
I promise
See I think I would have been fine dealing with this on my own
I just felt bad for not telling you)

(I feel like being around me aggravated you and I feel super guilty)

(It's okay)

(I'm glad you told me
I want to know you)

(It's not your fault
I'm just used to being alone
I normally deal with everything up in my head solo)

(Me too)

(Yeah I get that too)

(I was less successful for awhile though 😂
I know this is scary, but this is the happiest I've been in so long ryan
I just want us to be happy)

(I'm really happy around you
It's like a drug
So I don't know why you're bagging on me haha
Just kidding I know)

(Shuddup)

(Mmm)

(I'm trying to take care of you
From the other side of America 
I am too)

(Let's keep it that way)

(Listen to them say pop and not soda)

(And their delicious accents)

(Freakin inbreds 😂)

(This is good)

(Mmmm
Learn that accent for me 😏
Haha)

(Humor is good)

(It'd be better in a western accent 😏)

(😑)

(Much good, such humor 
Like girl)

(I thought you said it was good 😂)

(I do like good boys)

(Like boy
Good boy)

(You've come to the right place 😏)

(Ugh dammit)

(This gets worse and worse doesn't it 😂)

(😂😭 sorry for being like this)

(It's okay)

(Haha)

(You like boys)

(You can't change who you are mollie)

(Even if you change that haircut)

(Frick)

(Yeah that's a deeper issue I think)

(There's the heat 
Mmmmmm
Roast me
🔥🔥🔥 I wanna feel the fire
Haha
Good boy)

(Getting turned on by insults and insinuations)

(MMMMMMM)

(Well hey now)

(Some say issue, some say fetish 
As long as it's not illegal it's not a problem)

(Oh damn, it IS)

(Whatever it's not like we pay attention to the law)

(you sick fuck
Haha)

(So many times
Like seriously, everything)

(Soooo many times)

(Like going to parks when it's illegal to be in them after dusk)

(😏😏😏😏 that's what makes it hot)

(Or hopping over cemetery fences)

(Mmmm cemetery)

("Mmm yeah")

(Too bad we can't drive in there 😂
Jk jk)

("Bend me over that headstone")

("Bang me so hard we raise the dead")

(😂 oh my god)

(😂 haha)

(Death orgy)

(Get on my level)

(Soooo many bones…)

(Jesus Christ haha)

(Yeahhhhh)

(He can join 😂)

(You're really on a roll)

(💁 I'm basically a circle rn soooo)

(Alright peace out)

(Yeah
Makes sense 
Shoot it gtg)

(I'll be dreaming of you 😘😂)

(Yeah me too)

(I'll keep my self occupied in the meantime
*in a safe and productive manner)

(Occupied with that hot video of Taylor and me? 😏)

(What was that even for? 😂)

(Oh productive 
Right)

(Just cuz)

(Whatever)

(😏 what can I say. Everyone wants some of thsi
*this)

(As long as it wasn't Natalie haha
Then I might get nervous)

(😂 she turns everyone)

(Uh huh)

(Haha
It's ok, I sent for your enjoyment 😂
You're welcome)

(Thanks)

(Anytime, just ask)

(But watching just isn't the same)

(😏 I don't think she'd want to share me)

(Hey my dad wants to know where in Indiana you are?)

(Haha
For the next nine days that's as good as you get)

(Wawasee)

(Right right)

(Driving in from Indianapolis 
*lake wawasee)

(He was just curious
Please take videos when you decide to get lit)

(😂 you bet your ass I will)

(Which side again?)

(Haha it's always lit with this side of the fam)

(😂 papas)

(Oh nice)

(Okay so apparently we've been through that area a bunch
My dad went to college like an hour away from that town)

(Really?! Where?)

(Kalamazoo Michigan)

(My family's all over here, we probably know it)

(Haha if we were on our RV trip we would have been there for a couple of weeks the same time you were)

(DAMMMIT)

(Have you ever been to shipshewana with all the Amish?)

(That would've been so lit)

(It's only 30 min away from you 😂)

(Actually, no 
I honestly don't really get off the lake 😂)

(But a bunch of menanites work for my cousin if that counts)

(They make really nice furniture...)

(Haha)

(Oh yes)

(😏 so they're good at working wood)

(I know
Believe me
I know)

(No wonder you always came around here)

(Frick mollie)

(😏)

(I'm so many levels
*on
Haha that's so funny. I can't believe that we would have been that close to you)

(So many times)

(Lots and lots of coincidences)

(That's so frickin weird
On so many levels)

(Fate)

(Right right)

(😂 fate that we didn't actually meet until last year)

(Honestly that's probably a good thing
I don't think I would have done well in school with you around)

(Me neither)

(I don't get why he thinks I'm so damn smart)

(Honestly
😂 then joe wouldn't be able to brag about you so much)

(I literally have done nothing in front of him)

(You solved the knot ryan 😂)

(Right right)

(Haha he thinks you're like a genius hacker)

(Yeah black screens with white text scare people)

(He saw something on my computer that looked abnormal and he was impressed)

(Nice)

(Exactly)

(I'll pull up porn next time
Jk jk)

(NO)

(Ugh the firewalls)

(you would never touch my computer again
Haha
You couldn't
It doesn't work 😂
That's one of my safety measures)

(Okay mollie I need to go)

(Haha)

(Also cruise night is on July 12th in Auburn from 5pm to 8pm, just fyi)

(Same
See ya)

(Ok ok. What exactly does that entail?)

(Okay okay)

(Also, I want to take you to the rodeo)

(Maybe)

(I literally fell asleep ten minutes before this came through ugh)

(Probably for the best. I would've kept you up haha)

(And that did not answer my question 😂)

(And yeah I'll describe it later. It's pretty cool though...)

(😂 your book already did)

(Oh good)

(I slept through boat church 😂)

(I've been reading your book too
What page number did you make it to?)

(Uhh like 30ish. Idk I started it in bed)

(Yeah I don't mind his writing style either. It's really easy to read)

(It's really good)

(The book I have? Yeah it flows like thoughts it's nice)

(Uh)

(So do you know if you're free Saturday night on the 15th?)

(Uhhh for what?)

(I kinda want to do another airbnb but you have to book them ahead of time)

(That seems highly plausible)

(Oh damn)

(￼￼)

(Uhhh
Ok 
Weekends are good)

(But I need a good alibi)

(Yeah I know)

(Woahhhhh)

(It's honestly okay if you can't)

(I really really want to)

(I just wanted a night alone for once)

(Me too)

(Okay let me know soon)

(I have to see
Hmmmm)

(Alrighty)

(I don't even know what your cover would be)

(My parents are at a wedding)

(Right right)

(So that just leaves the kids
Soooo if someone has a grad party or something?)

(When's the wedding?)

(That night)

(I mean they let you overnight at Tahoe with a bunch of kids)

(Right that's what I'm saying)

(Do they normally call the parents?)

(No)

(Haha okay)

(I don't think so
But with you around idk
That's all)

(I just want to be safe)

(With Lucas, they didn't call)

(But honestly)

(I'd be willing to risk it)

(Oh shoot you're right)

(Right
Sooo
I think I can swing it
The only thing is that night is that they probably want me to watch the kids)

(I don't see why Audrey can't manage herself since she's 14 🙄)

(And I'm guessing weekdays are off limits?)

(But whatever
I'll see)

(I'm working then is all 😒)

(Because I'm guessing that the weekend slot is gonna get booked in day or two)

(That's how it normally goes)

(Idk. Papa might talk to mom)

(Damn)

(I know
But idk what'll happen until at least that week probably
I'm sorry)

(That's fine
We'll just play it by ear
And hope for the best)

(That's such a cool place 😂)

(I know I know)

(Haha as always)

(It's a five minute walk from Arden)

(Lo siento babe)

(And right by all of these shops in downtown sac)

(Awwww)

(And river access is super close too...)

(That would be so fun
Ugh
Ok ok
I'll try my best)

(What a prime location)

(Ooh)

(Right right)

(A place to hide the body
Good thinking)

(Yours or mine?
Eh we'll cross that bridge when we get there)

(Whoever loses 😏)

(Winner takes all)

(Haha so what's cruise night?)

(Oh right)

(Exactly)

(On every third Friday from May to Sept)

(They jam pack downtown auburn with cool cars from every era
And there's popcorn and snocones typically)

(Yeahhhhhh)

(Last time we went I think we saw a couple of datsuns)

(YEAHHHH
CARS)

(Kyle was hyped)

(YEAHHHHHH)

(I think michael wanted to go, so probably as a group if that's alright)

(I freakin love those)

(Perfect)

(Lessdoit)

(Group stuff is the best stuff
😏)

(Aw I'm glad you liked it
It definitely makes you want to do random things just for the sake of living
Like running around an airport at night to pick up a girl 😂)

(😊 exactly. Makes you wanna live life to the fullest)

(Oh hey)

(I'm so glad I met you
That's an understatement. But me too, I can't begin to tell you how much you've done for me
That's an understatement. But me too, I can't begin to tell you how much you've done for me
Lemme see
Uhhhh
Yes
Mmmmm yeah
What's going on)

(YeahhhhhhhHHHHHHH)

(It works now)

(So fast)

(What'd you do?!)

(So I fixed it 😂)

(Haha I can't believe that worked
It was a long shot
I called you on FaceTime audio which uses kind of the same protocol as imessage
So I guess it was a wake up call that we both have a solid data connection after all)

(Das good nerdy talk)

(Mmm)

(Data connection almost as solid as our menstrual connection)

(Eww)

(Solid menstruation)

("Solid")

(So uh)

(Ewwww
No more
Lo siento)

(How's it hanging miss mollie?)

(Uh)

(Eww)

(Today I was running and a bug went in my eye and I found it eight hours later dead in there)

(I did six miles like that)

(That's terrible)

(Woah nice job girl)

(My body conquers all)

(That's a 10k)

(Well it was cuz I got lost but 😂)

(Haha well a 10k for you...)

(Yeah)

(Probably two hours right?
Hahaha
Just kidding...
Running is so nice. I feel so much better since I started again)

(Aww)

(Haha thanks)

(Notice that was a short one 
Because I felt less empathy for you
Cuz you tried to call me slow
How are you?
I've been wanting to check in but I didn't want to bother you)

(Honestly it's been great
I've found out what I've been missing for a while
Just being alone and doing stuff by myself
No offense or anything 😂
But I've spent too much time with friends and you and I didn't realize it)

(Yeah kinda same)

(Sometimes it's good for me just to drive around by myself for a couple of hours and sit at parks and read)

(😂 like I didn't sleep for two weeks)

(I can fall asleep anywhere now)

(Haha nice)

(Yeah I get that)

(And I get so happy to go home)

(Yeah it does really)

(It makes you grateful)

(And also I haven't written any code for fun since we started
So I did that again finally
I used to write stuff everyday for hours
And I started a new project that will either get me loaded or waste a lot of time 😂)

(Soooo I should stay friends with you cuz you'll be loaded?)

(Nah it'll make a good story 😂)

(😂 haha
Damn
Sorry I screwed you up so much)

(I think we'll be better now that I have a broader appreciation and understanding of myself
We can have more fun now... it's just kicking off
Starting with that Airbnb... that you need to confirm)

(That's so adult of you 😂)

(Nononono)

(I'll try to do a better job of giving you space 
Ok)

(Mollie I don't want space haha
Well I mean a little
But in my head I had everything all twisted)

(What was it?)

(Haha a little bit)

(I mean I kinda know
Was it just stressing you out though? I get that)

(But more so that I was focused on what you wanted from me and what others expected from me)

(I know. That's been freaking me out too)

(Yeah it was this weird gap where I cared too much)

(Instead of my typically nonchalant self 😂 
Like all of the anxiety I got when people saw that maybe I liked you
But that's gone away slowly. Like during school I couldn't even talk to you with people around
But like at Lucas' thing I was so chill with everything
So thanks really)

(Uhhh anytime)

(You've changed (fixed?) me a tiny bit)

(I mean)

(Whatever this is too much talking and feeling for me)

(I just sorta existed)

(Holy crap mollie)

(But you're welcome?
Maybe you changed me a little too
Haha me too
So how about this for space but not being left alone
You write your fun code
While I go down
Open to feedback)

(I can't even
That'd be so weird 😂)

(😂 there's my response)

(Hahaha I don't know)

(Could you do it?)

(I'm more than willing to try 😂)

(I'd go easy on you round one)

(Right right)

(😂 to be fair)

(We'll set a task
Like "Ryan code a program to calculate Pi or something"
(Which is a lot harder than you'd think...)
I think it'd be a competition for blood between my organs 😂
I don't know if I can do both at the same time without killing the other)

(Haha)

(Hahaha)

(We can time you
This sounds like fun
A good test of willpower
Though I'd almost feel threatened if I lost 😂)

(Yeah that'd be sad
Like if I lost, you know, because I was more focused elsewhere
😂)

(It'd be sad for everyone)

(More so you though...)

(Good
High stakes)

(Ok now)

(Like what)

(High stakes)

(I'd be okay with reciprocating too. You know that right?
If you would maybe just shower
😂)

(😂 I can change the light colors)

(YEAH)

(Haha
If you show me how to again first)

(That's on my checklist too
Not teaching you code
But a shower 😏)

(Damn I was hoping for the former 😂)

(So mollie for all of this stuff...)

(Haha
That sounds dangerous
But I love a challenger)

(We're gonna need a place alone...)

(I KNOE)

(We could literally jam pack it all in one night)

(Mmmm)

(Just walk up to your parents and say "Hey there's this get together on Saturday where we might go the fair and stay up all night. And some of the kids will sleepover too")

(It'd barely fit
But you just gotta jam pack it in)

(Mollie we can have socks, showers, coding, everything dammit)

(Then jam it all in)

(And we can sleep for once)

(Hahaha no 😂)

(That actually sounds great)

(Socks don't belong there)

(Or the LEDs)

(WHY THO)

(Maybe some socks...)

(Unless there's a very specific sock scenario)

(I'm so confused)

(I feel like them would be fun
*the 
THEN)

("I feel like then would be fun"?
Are we talking about the special socks?)

(What are you talking about? 😂)

(What are *you* talking about? 😂)

(Uhhhh)

(Oh right okay)

(Fantastical situations
That I want to make a reality)

(Too many levels of innuendos)

(😂 I dot know how you could've let that one go but I'll let you slide this one time)

(Yeah I'm still kinda lost)

(Whatever
Mollie just find out soon okay? Before they get booked)

(Tall thigh high socks)

(Yes yes I want those on you)

(Ok ok
I'll try
I need to talk to Bree and all to get an alibi)

(I was hinting at the fancy small socks that have weird effects)

(Mmm I like the way that sounds)

(But yeah okay)

(Oh)

(Haha)

(😂 too many directions)

(😂 we can try that too)

(Yeah work on stuff with your alibi
I'll get back to being productive)

(Alrighty then)

(Well that was vague)

(Goodnight, Asian lover
Thanks for everything)

(But yeah okay
￼
Dammit)

(Ooh)

("Something to lee"?)

(Sorry
But I just realized that I probably need something to lee to happen before I commit to a date for one of these
Because if it happened on that date you would be very disappointed)

(Haha it's not the end of the world)

(*to happen 😂)

(Yeah better safe than sorry)

(You didn't talk to bree or anything yet right?)

(What?)

(Okay yeah)

(About what?
Oh
No
She should be in town for a while now that she's back)

(Just be careful
Honestly she'll tell everyone anything she wants 😐)

(I am very aware)

(Hey when/where is the rodeo btw?)

(Hmmm)

(Haha it's okay really. I don't know what a rodeo even entails but in my mind the state fair would be a lot more fun)

(I usually go to the Folsom one but I have a bad feeling this weekend might have been the last
I'll do my best to make that happen)

(But I'm not a horse girl 🤷🏻‍♀️)

(You don't wanna watch a bunch of country bumpkins get gored by bulls?)

(*cowboy)

(Oh wait
The state fair has a rodeo 😂
You'll get your share
Horse boy 🐴👲🏽)

(Right right)

(Oh gosh)

(Cuz you like to ride)

(*oh gosh*)

(ooh goosh)

(Ha)

(I'm not doing this)

(Oooh gooosh)

(You should've learned from Tommy)

(Ah found it
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yeCFK9wlSUY
Pretty much embodies me)

(Your divinity?)

(Oh right)

(*dignity
Oh
"Lick her from her toes to her thigh"
Um 
No)

(Foot stuff
Not okay
Apparently)

(😂 apparently?)

(Hey now)

(You've got the thing against most stuff
🤗)

(Mmmhhmmmm)

(That's not true)

(Please cite evidence to support your claim)

(Okay well first of all, if we're getting graphic, some orifices are off limits)

(I don't want that
And I know for a fact that you don't)

(Dodging the prompt)

(Oh noes)

(Typical ap response
Haha)

(Those are out tomorrow
Anyways I'm fine with the other stuff Mollie
I'm just not good at it 😂
...I think my tongue is too small)

(Oh no)

(That I don't have apparently)

(They are
Ew haha no
It's ok
It's a talent)

(You're too gifted in other areas)

(Right)

(You can't have everything 
Unless you're me
But I'm an exception)

(Just list out everything you have why don't you
Circulation problems
Chronic Dino hands
Etc
Not everyone can have that 😂)

(All things that I have)

(Uh it depends on what it does?)

(Not things that I lack
💁💁💁
Hey Ryan how much is a program worth)

(That's like saying, "Hey Ryan how much is a thought worth?"
Or, "Hey Ryan how much is a thot worth?")

(Ok that's what I thought but aunt Megan wanted to know 😂)

(What were you guys talking about?)

(Now I'm interested
Before I was bored)

(Right. The only reason you talk to me)

(Uh well now this feels weird)

(You)

(Literally why else would we talk about code 😂)

(And I feel like this convo took a slightly egocentric turn)

(Touché)

(Hmmm)

(Damn those glasses girl)

(I'll just say it's based on the creative capacity of the writer 
So not very much)

(Who's are they?)

(I owned them as soon as they graced my visage)

(They're not bad honestly 😂)

(Haha they're my aunts
Told you glasses are hot)

(😂)

(I feel like you could pull them off)

(Thanks. I live for your validation)

(I'm banking on that)

(You should be)

(Haha no)

(😂
Ryan Jacobs, are you just sitting in the AC parking lot talking to me?)

(I'm on the move now)

(What?!)

(I'm not driving 😂)

(On the move?)

(Yeah...)

(I'm in a car
But I'm not driving)

(Bumming rides from the boys?)

(Pretty much)

(They don't let you drive cuz you're Asian)

(Hey I got into my first accident
But no one knows)

(Except me)

(Ssssh)

(And I want to know everything)

(Haha I hit your tree 😂
It really screwed up the headlights)

(My tree?!)

(Badly)

(What)

(Yeah there's this huge scrape)

(When)

(Ryan)

(That night that everyone was over)

(When?!)

(I was so damn close to the fence)

(😂 nooooo)

(Didn't hit the fence tho)

(After all that emotion
You had to hit my tree)

(I think the tree's okay)

(Oh good)

(Honestly it was really funny)

(That high quality fence would've been noticed 🙄😂
Aww Ryan)

(I was on the hill facing the tree
Like inches away
And to add gas, you gotta let out the clutch and roll forward
Too much gravity 😂
And I clipped it)

(Freakin Asian drivers man)

(Mollie that was literally my first accident ever)

(What about you?
Oh right
You're so perfect)

(Thatssss righhhttttt)

(Hahaha)

(Like
The day that I my car showed up at my house
Driving home from school I didn't supposedly brush against another car while pulling out in boyington in dad's truck  
Then get yelled at by some stuffy mom
I never felt it and there was no mark
But she says I did
But whatever)

(Typical women driver
What happens when you get an Asian women?)

(Double negative)

(Androgynous Asian,)

(Just kidding
Asian overrules everything
There is no gender
Just Asian)

(I've got that petty persuasion,
Bringing home all the ladies,
Like a master of home invasion
🔥😎)

(They call him Ni-Hau home wrecker)

(Threesomes like a double decker)

(😂😂 haha
Who you spending the fourth with boy?)

(Haha just my family this time)

(But the boys?!)

(I've literally spent every fourth in Michigan for the past ten years)

(Yeah I know
We're doing a bonfire on the 6th so... 🤷🏻‍♀️
That'll cover it)

(Awww)

(Right I'm on driving probation)

(And you're just they kid they have to drop off today
Hmmm)

(What?!)

(No of course not 😂)

(Really?)

(I should be though)

(You're a damn menace)

(No haha)

(Someone probate this kid
I don't feel safe
Awww Haha so you didn't unwittingly drive to the AC to absorb my lingering essence tonight?
Darn)

(I didn't even know that was your place until I saw an ad for capitol crew)

(😢)

(I thought I saw a bloodied handprint somewhere)

(Could you feel all the pain built up there
All the suffering)

(But then I was like, that's impossible with those calloused hands)

(Probably smelled the stench of vomit)

(Mmm hmm)

(Haha
HAHAHA
Don't you just love the feeling of those callouses scraping over you?
Mmmm)

(Do you even still have them?)

(Honestly)

(Me too 😐)

(My hands will never be the same
I lost my hand virginity)

(And they'll never be the same)

(I don't even know where to go from there)

(Knowing why they know
*what)

(The haunting smell)

(Out damned spot out)

(Idk Ryan
They're you hands
Your
Haha)

(Oh hell yeah)

("You can finish, it's ok")

(I'm so glad I chose you
Ew
That's grosser the longer you look
Haha happy fourth
You can hang with your boys it's ok)

(Thanks mollie)

(Exactly)

(Adios)

(I got you 😉
Goodnight)

(How do you say goodnight in Spanish?
Beunos noches or something?)

(Beunas noches)

(I was close)

(The difference between an a and an o is a large one)

(Aww 😘)

(Typical programmer
Buenas noches
Te extraño, cariño)

(Apparently google translate can't translate "samsies")

("Yo tambien")

(At times maybe)

(People are better than computers 💁)

(😂
Alright seriously goodnight
See you in like 5 days)

(Finally)

(Well that was embarrassing)

(See you
Maybe
I'm sorry Ryan 
Last night, when I was trying to tell you goodnight, I wanted to tell you that I love you but I lost my nerve)

(Oh thank god you're awake)

(Nonono)

(Ryan
I'm so sorry
I'm hurting you
I've been wanting to tell you but I haven't had the courage
And it's hurting you
Do you want me gone?)

(It's fine)

(Stop saying that)

(I don't want you gone)

(It's obviously not)

(It was hurting me a lot)

(Drunk you wanted me gone)

(Yeah)

(Thinking I didn't feel the same way?
I'm so sorry)

(That's okay
Honestly I feel like shit
Definitely lost my cool last night)

(Just a little bit)

(Idk)

(What happened?
It seemed like you'd been feeling better
But last night was awful)

(Mollie I really don't want to talk about this now
I'm sorry our first time was over text
That seems lame in retrospect)

(Me too)

(Yeah samsies)

(That's why I didn't say anything last night 
It's ok
I guess it's good we talked 
Ryan I'll do better
I swear 
I'm gonna figure this out)

(I'm so so sorry)

(It's okay)

(*samesies)

(Frick)

(It's not)

(But it will be)

(Yo tambien)

(Cuidate mi cariño)

(Sounds good)

(Just till Sunday)

(I'm sorry for this mess
Don't say it's okay
I put this on you and I feel terrible for it)

(😂 you're the one who says that)

(Alright)

(It's ok
That's how relationships work
Not even romantic ones
Just people ones
I'm sorry too
Ryan call me next time, or text me
Don't just drink 
Just let me tell you
Ok?)

(I promise I'll do that next time)

(Thank you)

(Yeah you too)

(Please take care of yourself)

(Alright I need to start my day by the looks of it)

(Alright. Keep in touch)

(Oh damn)

(Alright jacobs, I'm going to bed in the next few minutes, so if you have any pressing concerns or deep questions now would be a good time to get them off your chest
And don't avoid me
Cmon boy you're not sleeping yet
Respond so I can get my beauty sleep
You know I need it
Ryan please be ok
Cmon 
Just a text
I need peace)

(I was taking a nap
All good here honestly
I'm about to go running)

(Praise the lord)

(Did you not get it?)

(Good boy
You run
Hey, were you trying to send me thumbs-up pics last night?)

(Anyways I found this last night scrolling through my photos
Okay I need to go now
The sun already set twenty minutes ago and I don't want to run into a tree today)

(Awww)

(Uh maybe)

(I know that one but I meant all the dark blurry ones 😂
Ok ok)

(The lighting wasn't the best haha)

(Not a lot was going for you 😂)

(Wait is this a game you just learned?)

(Nighty night mr jacobs
Te amo)

(Or did you know it beforehand?)

(Well I just kinda relearned it because it's got a lot of layers and etiquette)

(￼)

(It's an important game to my family ifk
Idk
It's a card game
My family is super into cards on this side)

(I do like cards
I'll play you in poker 😂
I've got a great poker face)

(No fun emojis next to my name?)

(Do you have any on mine? 😂)

(Hmpf
Haha)

(The face you make when you're trying not to finish?)

(Anything is better than "Asian #2")

(Dammit mollie)

(…Asian #3?)

(Why do you pay attention to that)

(Oh gosh)

(Cuzzzz technically you were after Kailen)

(I hope I'm not Asian #3)

(Idk I like watching 😂)

(I'm just trying to be close to you geez)

(The numbers are in order of meeting)

(Yes)

(It's a ranking system)

(Actually you'd be 4 then…)

(*not in order of meeting)

(Shoot
I have to change it)

(You can be Chinese #3)

(Halfbreed 2)

(That spots open)

(Haha)

(Ugh)

(No they're in order of who I like best 😂
*halfbreed 4
Please)

(Jackie Chan can take Chinese #1
I'm okay with that)

(Soooo)

(And you can be white girl #76)

(Chinese #4 then)

(There's so many of you around these parts
How exotic)

(There are 75 better white girls than me? 😂)

(Hahaha)

(Peyton better be number one)

(But he's half?
Idk what he is)

(White)

(Uh no)

(In his soul
Where it counts)

(It's the skin that counts I'm pretty sure
Otherwise you get lynched)

(Obviously 💁 what's on the outside tells you what's on the inside duh)

(There you go)

(Now we're on track again)

(Now we're synced 😂)

(Solid)

(Yes it is)

(Ew)

(😏)

(How is that btw?
I wish you were here
I wanna ask questions
And see you get fed up with me)

(Idk I'm like 800 mg of ibuprofen in)

(Alright I just grabbed a charger)

(Haha
Ask away
I'm all answers
Cuz I'm a know it all
I wish you were here
So I could take you skinny dippin because it's lucky for unmarried couples here
Guess I'll just be floating around naked by myself out there)

(My phones at 1%
Uh I don't even know where to start)

(Start fast I'm gonna run soon)

(Mmm running)

(Go go go)

(In more ways than one
Okay two questions:
How does this effect your sex drive right now? I'm just curious, because you were a little aggressive the week before you left
And uh how does it effect your sleep?)

(It like skyrockets cuz I make so much estrogen and testosterone and stuff)

(Wait I thought you peak right before your period)

(Ummm
I think I usually sleep lighter maybe?)

(But I'm more tired)

(Haha)

(Before and throughout it
It's your body's way of punishing you for not conceiving)

(Ha)

(So more naps)

(...)

(Ha ha)

(So basically when you return
You'll be really tired and sick of me
Dammit)

(I'll probably be very excited for you)

(Ugh)

(Whatever I usually feel it's the same on my period just wayyyy stronger)

(So happier, sadder, more everything)

(I want to experience you in that state)

(So don't piss me off)

(Do you though 😂)

(Not in the bedroom way entirely 😂)

(Haha)

(But just be around you)

(I'll really bet you up now)

(Probably gonna eat my words later)

(I guess I can be more fun too)

(Mmm)

(Haha yeah
We'll see won't we?
Haha ok I gotta run a little so I can sleep maybe
My flight is at 6 again)

(Nice
So are you thinking that I should pick you up?
Or would that be frowned upon? 😂)

(Hmmmm)

(Honestly it's okay if that was a one time thing)

(Idk
I think I might be back at like midnight)

(But I'd be happy to see you)

(I can wait 12 hours)

(I would too
Hmmm)

(Like I was thinking of just driving over anyway 😂)

(Yeah that would be rad)

(And idk if I have work the next day or not)

(Like it might start late but idk)

(I'd meet you half way 😂)

(Uhhh
I might need to sleep on that)

(Awww)

(Alright we'll just play it by ear)

(It'll all work out)

(Mmm hmm)

(It always does)

(Alright you should go run)

(I am running 😂)

(Gotta get in good shape for me)

(Eww)

(Right right)

(*mental shape)

(That's what running is for anyways)

(I can't wait to destroy you in bridge you snarky little ass)

(I'll find a way to cheat)

(And I wonder if you'll get one)

(*shudders*)

(Please let me know in four years 😂)

(I'd laugh so much if you got one)

(I hope I don't get a so cal one)

(HOT)

(Mmm we'll totally chill and hang loose)

(We could have a sexy reunion 😂)

(YE BOSTEN MUTHAFUCKA

(Ugh mollie buy them)

(*if it gets me socks
*if it gets me a sweet schoolgirl)

(Ugh ok)

(Ughhhhh)

(Oh shoot I actually meant to do that here)

(Match?)

(Haha ok
Any other requests?
Should I match or what's the fantasy?)

(I'm not wearing socks 😂)

(My attire)

(Oh)

(Oh god 😂)

(Nah)

(Haha)

(I'm just imagining you in nothing but white thigh high socks)

(And that really gets me going for some reason
Idk why)

(Mmm)

(Mmm good song)

(Haha
You're a simple man
I respect that
Less work for me)

(I don't think that was the message tho 😂
Okay well if you have any requests, let me know
I have a solution for your thing)

(Really?)

(When you get back, I'll show you)

(I'm kinda worried)

(Nah it's not bad
It only involved a laser refraction set and four $50 lenses)

(Wtf)

(Solution yes)

(Mmm
Magic to my ears
😂 wait are you real?)

(Lasers no
Lenses no)

(Aww lasers probably would've got me going too)

(Oh like stumpy)

(Pussy likes the red dot)

(Das right)

(￼Mmm I do like free stuff)

(All hints)

(Holy crap)

(Yes it does)

(That looks awesome)

(Mollie my sleep schedule is whacked
I'm not even tired and it's 4 in the morning)

(Holy crap)

(Met a bunch?)

(I actually feel like I'm dying I'm so tired 
I met a bunch last night to talk and play cards and I guess I did a good job
But I'm gonna lose consciousness)

(Of your future classmates?)

(Yeah. We all got together in a Lobby)

(Woah that's pretty sweet)

(And I guess you've been up since?)

(Haha no but I definitely haven't slept enough 😂)

(Awww please do)

(Ryan even though I know about our agreement and how we only have this summer, I really hope you come to Boston sometime, and I hope when you do that you call me, and I hope that I'm around and can go get you and take you around 
Because it's magical here)

(Don't worry I'm not gonna forget you
You can visit LA too
Mollie you've made such a positive impact on my life, and left such fond memories in my heart. I'll keep in touch every now and then, I promise
Just hurry up and come home so I can kiss you and hug you until you can't breathe anymore)

(Oh thank god)

(It's alright)

(Dammit I don't know what you've done to me
All last night all I could do was think of you in that stupid group 
I'm so screwed)

(You'll get your fix in these next months)

(I'm holding you to that 😂)

(Sweeeeet)

(Oh Ryan, of course I will)

(Hey before you take off, what's the plan?)

(Uhhhh)

(Hopefully your grammar will be better by then)

(Wow nice timing
Idk
Mom says flight is like 6 hours or something 
So I probably get to me house at like 9:30)

(These people o'r here all talk like dis)

(Yeah I think you should sleep on the plane)

(Wtf 
Sorry I'm tired 😂)

(I'd sleep even if I didn't want to 😂)

(Haha that seems out of character)

(That's cuz you only see one side of me)

(Haha okay)

(You don't even know boy)

(Whatever you say)

(Also I'm like 65% sure my period ended today!)

(Anyways, did you let your parents know you'd be out? Or are we just gonna wing it?)

(Yayyy)

(That's a good sign)

(Uhhh)

(Welp)

(I usually ask for forgiveness 
Cuz Mom says no to everything)

(Okay, let's say you get home at 10:00
Then we go out until midnight
That's reasonable right?)

(I think so)

(Lessdoit)

(Let's do it)

(Lessdoit boi)

(Yeah last time we stayed out until 4am)

(🤗 what happens happens)

(Pssh)

("Let's just sit inside this truck for a bit" 😂)

(Mmmmm)

(Mmm)

(That truck tho)

(Please don't make a bloody mess)

(Nah that should be done)

(Okay okay)

(I won't
No pressure here
I can take care of myself)

(I trust that you have more experience)

(Yeah but I think you might've covered the material more in depth 😂)

(Whaaaa)

(￼
Mollie I wish you were there yesterday)

(Me tooooo dammit)

(Yeah me too)

(I guess orientation was great 
But I missed so much at home 
Ugh 
I miss you so much Ryan 
It's killing me)

(A lot)

(I'm just really hormonal 😂)

(I'll see you in like 7 hours)

(So that's a plus)

(7 longgggg hours)

(I just want to hug and kiss you)

(So much right now)

(I want that too)

(Oh gosh)

(I always wanna fuck the shit out of you but I'll wait for you)

(Mollie I'm seriously laughing out loud right now
Jesus Christ
I want that too, maybe I'll grab "supplies")

(I've literally been thinking about it like all trip)

(Okay me too)

(I've had a lot of time to just think 😂)

(Not gonna lie)

(I'm so frustrated 😂)

(Ugh mollie)

(Haha
Thinkin bout your socks?
Awwww)

(Glad you think about me tooooo)

(I literally can't stop thinking about that)

(It's weird
And incredibly sexy)

(Me neither actually)

(Like really)

(I really like the idea of it now 😂)

(As long as it's not yeast that's growing)

(It grew on me)

(😂 okay I'll stop)

(Eewww Ryan)

(Hahaha)

(You killed the sexy
That's probably good since I'm about to be on a six hour flight though 😂)

(Can you become a member of the mile high by yourself?
A first solo flight
If you catch my drift)

(Oh god)

(But it might be an awkward walk back along the aisle)

(I was just thinking thy actually
Like can I get away with it
Maybe)

(I can be quick when I'm in the mood)

(Uh huh)

(Okay what the hell
Mollie I'm making an executive decision)

(Uhhh)

(We're going to go stargazing somewhere for an hour)

(And then we're going to rendezvous at the auburn house for a little get together
I can't care
I want you so bad right now
*don't care
Whatever)

(Me too)

(Haha yesterday michael and I ran all the way to target at like 10:30 pm)

(Christ
I'm so jealous you're home rn and I'm getting in a plane)

(It's just not the same without you
Late nights at target)

(Michael just doesn't comply as well)

(Don't get me wrong)

(Haha
It's a talent, ryan)

(I tried
Sorry Michael)

(Oh I know how you are)

(Nah I had to stop because of my conscious)

(Ok sure you did
*im
😂 surprised you couldn't convince him
Tho he does usually back out of things 🙄)

(He's too childlike
I swear michaels the little kid of the group 😂
He's the best though)

(He odds)

(A gateway drug)

(*isss
He was my first friend of that group 
No regrets)

(To a lot of weirdos
Anyways, I don't care if I keep you out until 2am. Or if your mom gets mad. She'll just have to deal with it. And I'll make it up to you guys later with bridge or something
But mollie
Tonight you're mine for a few hours at least)

(Ugh that's just what I wanted to hear)

(Haha well normally I'm a little more reserved)

(Talk to me like that tonight)

(Don't be)

(But Mollie, I seriously want to fuck you so bad right now)

(Like every fiber of my body is tingling)

(Just be aggressive and talk to me)

(I want you so freaking bad)

(Jesus)

(Haha too much?)

(Ok)

(We need to calm down I'm stuck in a freaking plane 😂)

(😂 Jesus Christ)

(Haha no perfect)

(Yeah same)

(That's good
Haha ok I should probably go)

(I'm gonna get too pent up)

(WAIT IT OUT)

(I need to go distract myself)

(Good boy)

(Mmm brb)

(See you later 😏)

(Going to Walmart
Haha see you in a bit)

(I slept)

(Proud of you)

(💁 same)

(Alright just keep me in the loop)

(Ok we're driving rn
Just left)

(I'm eating dinner with my family rn
What's our transportation situation?)

(Uhhh I believe Felix is home and we'll)

(Hmm alright)

(Well)

(Well I'm just thinking that your parents would be more okay with you leaving with your car and staying out late, than me whisking you away and dropping you off at 1am
So it all depends)

(Trueee)

(But my parents are completely okay with whatever 😂)

(Hmmm)

(Lucky duck)

(So I'm driving to Griffith park right now)

(Sooo)

(Oh okay)

(My family
Might be going into Walmart rn 😅
Cuz we have no food)

(Would they be opposed if you hung back? 😂)

(I'm still in the car with them)

(Yeah I mean at Walmart tho...)

(😂)

(Uhhh)

(That's right next to the cargo containers)

(Ifk
*idk
Might work though 
Time might be better)

(Cuz idk how long it'll be)

(We're just stargazing haha)

(True)

(That might be a good idea)

(🙄)

(Be honest with them
I should bring that outdoor blanket shouldn't I)

(You should)

(Yesss)

(Papa says he doesn't care
Sooo)

(I'm not hungry
But there's in-n-out if you really wanted 😂
Okay I'll going to hide my car in the Walmart parking lot
I'll text you in like 12 minutes)

(Uhhh ok)

(How close are you?)

(Oh wait you mean sneak away rn?
Ok)

(Lemme see)

(Oh no)

(I'm in Walmart)

(I'm at home still)

(Oh haha)

(Don't sneak away)

(That's a bad call)

(Well I told papa)

(Okay the quicker I stop texting you, the sooner I'll be there)

(Ok ok)

(Dammit)

(Shit moms super mad
It's not gonna fly)

(Gyrgffgvffh)

(Um)

(No go?)

(I'm certainly not going anywhere)

(Fuck)

(I'm here)

(FUCK)

(Well close)

(Aw
Where)

(Gimme 2 min)

(Uh my car is leaving)

(Well you'll see me)

(DAMMIT)

(Byeee)

(FUCKVLC
WHERE
I just passed you)

(Guess I'm going shopping for a bit
I'll wander around walmart and think of you)

(Ugh)

(Like what the hell)

(So close)

(Literally right next to each other)

(Why?)

(She's so pissed
But)

(The way she's talking)

(Mollie I'm actually very sad right now)

(It sounds like I might not have work tomorrow
Idk
She's just an angry person
She has high standards
And she doesn't like you)

(Or me)

(I wanted to see you so bad tonight)

(Tell me about it)

(So I'm definitely on her bad side right now?)

(Well shit)

(Uhhh)

(Don't lie)

(I think she's mostly just mad at me)

(Like what?)

(But you're like a distraction or something
So she picks on you too
Sorry
This always happens)

(Mollie tell me)

(Just, with any friend she kinda dunes the worst)

(But is there anything in particular concerning me?)

(She just thinks people are lazy and kids aren't raised right and that sort of thing 
*assumes)

(Not really, just that you're involved with me 😂)

(Also I'm not an angry person and I don't get frustrated easily)

(But this seriously annoys me)

(This sent me to therapy 😂)

(Like I feel like need to run a marathon)

(I feel)

(Ok maybe that's a bit extreme)

(Dammit)

(A lot went into that
But it's one of the biggest factors 
Anyways
Me too
Just gonna go home and give in to my compulsions)

(Mollie
Don't you fucking do that)

(It's ok, it's not like I get super drunk or hurt myself or anything)

(Hey watch it there)

(And it's not like I have a lot of control over it either)

(Don't worry about it)

(Ygagdbhesjsh)

(Haha
Sorry)

(Fuck
Fine
Tomorrow)

(I wasn't exactly waiting for your permission 😂)

(I just wanted one night with you)

(Yeah
Tomorrow for sure)

(Dammit)

(Me too)

(Nothing even needed to happen)

(Ugh
Stop)

(I'm still hormonal I might cry)

(I just wanted to hold you again)

(Dammit Ryan)

(...I got all nice and clean tonight though)

(Let's look at pros
I'll be all nice and clean tomorrow
And I can shave my mustache 🤗😂
Haha)

(Awww baby)

(🙄I know you like it dirty)

(For once oh could've been clean and I would've been dirty
Maybe for once we can both be clean 😂)

(Ok
Are you still in the car?)

(I know you like it sweet)

(Figure out the plan right now)

(Just about to get out)

(What's your schedule tomorrow?)

(The plan is, no one else is home tomorrow)

(I've been sleeping in until 2pm for the past 5 days)

(But it sounds like I might be)

(Oh god)

(So I need to know if I need to wake up 😂)

(Hey I'm still productive)

(If you could try to be a little more regular 😏)

(My best work is at 3am)

(*😂)

(How's your southern regions?)

(Damn programmers)

(*bether)

(Ur nether bether yat?)

(Nether)

(Probably also in need of some landscaping 😂)

(Well idk)

(Shuddup
Haha I'm not sure
Pretty much)

(I've read that it's like 5-7 days
Hasn't it only been like 3?)

(How long has it been)

(And I canceled the hotel)

(Uhh 
Maybe
It was kinda rough though
So it might be a short one)

(It looked seedy)

(Haha ok 😂)

(Uhhh)

(Snob)

(Okay
Whatever
Frick)

(I appreciate your concerns and efforts)

(I like the night so much better)

(Why couldn't we have met at night?
There's no way out of the house right now?)

(We're so much prettier 😂)

(Even if you're very convincing and logical?)

(In a body bag)

(You have no work tomorrow)

(Literally)

(It doesn't matter if you stay out)

(Nothing's going to happen)

(I think my dad might have talked to her about work and that got her mad)

(Literally looking at stars and imagining how small we really are)

(I think she thinks I said something to Susan and now she's all pissy but idk)

(With someone you care about
And she's going to deny you that
For what reason?)

(I don't even think she knows)

(Yeah don't worry about it)

(I'm so sorry
Ugh my rooms exactly the same as we left it
Dammit I want to talk
Ryan be ok tonight
Please)

(I'll be fine)

(Ok. Then a night won't be so bad)

(Screw it)

(I'm gonna look at the stars by myself tonight
I'm going to the park)

(Holy shit it just got here)

(🙄 idk what you're on about, but okay)

(I got it
The letter
At least I'll have some part of you tonight
Dammit I lost
Staring over rn
Good luck looking for stars with that full moon out)

(Well I'm not sure if you're awake yet
But I didn't sleep last night
I finished The Shadow of the Wind
And I don't know if you're keen to meet up this morning. I have no idea how much longer I'll go until I crash - but I'm feeling pretty solid as of now
Mollie I miss you)

(Holy)

(So my house or your house? I'm kinda leaning towards mine but whatever you want)

(Ugh finally slowpoke
Of course I wanna see you)

(Uhhh well it's 6 am)

(Yeah okay fair point)

(Mine will be empty in like an hour or so
Idk what you're is like
Yours)

(But do you think your parents would be cool with me coming over with you alone?
I mean would you even let them know?)

(Papa doesn't care, mom shouldn't know)

(That feels deceitful but it's your call)

(I mean, I think like Audrey will be here)

(Oh okay)

(That's better
I feel a lot more comfortable with that)

(I'm not supposed to technically see anyone according to her little yell thing last night)

(Oh well then)

(Nvm)

(But idk if that was just heat of the moment orrr)

(Why can't you see anyone?)

(Yeah)

(I think papa said something about working with her so much and she's a lil pissy about it)

(Please find out before I show up)

(Idk
I'm not sure what happened but I'm gonna find out today)

(Mollie I'm tired and I really don't want to deal with any crap)

(Haha I will it's ok)

(Alright well I'm going to eat breakfast)

(Just as long as mom isn't home I think you're good)

(Ok I'm going back to sleep)

(Ohhh sorry)

(I'll keep you updated)

(Btw your house is still an option if you want)

(I assumed you got up early)

(I feel asleep late)

(Yeah I would feel a bit more comfortable here)

(Haha ok I can do that too)

(Haha well I told you to sleep on the plane because I was anticipating you staying up until 2am)

(That kinda backfired)

(Mmmm hmmm)

(So you probably did stay up until 2am)

(Haha)

(Haha yeah)

(Sorry to be the bearer of bad news)

(Hey I can see stumpy this way!
Yayyyy)

(What?!)

(Haha jk)

(What happened)

(Nothing happened)

(Oh my god)

(Alright well hurry up before I fall asleep)

(Never
Never ever do that again
My heart
Ryan I would've cried)

(Probably an hour and half right?)

(I'm going to fall asleep)

(I think my sister has practice)

(Yeah probably
If you do can I still get in and just et in bed with you?
😂 or are there a bunch of people)

(And my parents might be doing errands
But that sounds sooo nice)

(Alright tell me
How to get in if everyone's gone)

(The couch is acceptable though)

(And o guess I'm just going for it)

(Well I didn't sleep)

(You sleep on the couch?)

(I was reading downstairs)

(Ohhh I see)

(Yeah if I'm passed out)

(So I have to break in, then find you)

(The back porch is unlocked as always
Just saunter in and shake me)

(Alrighty)

(Please don't sit on my face)

(And I'll know if people are there based on the car situation)

(Honestly don't worry about people too much. I'm pretty sure my family adores you now)

(Awww
How did you know)

(That you've given them a kitten)

(Alrighty then)

(Haha please do)

(I'll just saunter in and crawl into bed
Does this mean I can wear pajama shorts
Cuz I might
You know what I'll make the call)

(I'll put mine on if you do)

(YES)

(￼)

(Hell yeah)

(Mmmm)

(And bring chapstick, I've somehow managed to lose all of mine)

(That's what I wanna see
Nothing cuter than a boy in his jammies)

(Oh damn)

(Night running with Michael and I, yay or nay?)

(Alright here I come boy
I'm coming in)

(Uhhh)

(Probably start at 8:45-9:00 and go for 30 minutes tops)

(Probably nay 
Idk when mom will be here 
When are you going?)

(Hmmmm)

(Fingers crossed)

(I might actually be able to swing that let me see)

(Mollie do it for the story)

(I know I know)

(That's alright, I'm feeling pretty nice after that 3-8pm nap)

(I'm seeing
Hey, I'm sorry for pushing you earlier by the way
I know it makes you uncomfortable, I'm sorry I really just wanted to help)

(That might be part of the problem)

(Yeah your sleep schedule doesn't seem that great ryan)

(Anyways, if you get out tonight, I promise I'll talk a bit...)

(Then I'll definitely make it happen)

(12560 Erin dr)

(I'm here for you
Papa said yes
What's the plan)

(Go go go
Yayyy)

(Right now?!)

(Hi)

(God ok
Ok I'm here)

(Hi)

(Yeah)

(Hey boy
Don't forget me)

(I'm sorry
I should have talked
Well shit)

(I can turn)

(Please do)

(I'm all sweaty but whatever)

(Samesies)

("Samesies")

(Oh yeah, how was sneaking in at midnight?)

(The sneakiness ✌️)

(So not pissed)

(Go me
I'm really gettin this down)

(Well, mom didn't come wake me up in the morning)

(Wait... it's 11:00 am)

(Sooooo
I guess not)

(You're not working?)

(Not todayyyyy)

(Well if you wanna do anything, I'm probably down. I just have to work a bit. And Kyle got back from the bay and wanted to hang out with me)

(I'm sure I can squeeze you in somewhere...)

(Alrighty. I can't do anything until at least after 3:30-4:00 but I'll pencil you in somewhere)

(Sounds gucci, ms. luci)

(You will be erased if you continue with that particular moniker, sir)

(￼￼)

(Tuesdays are cheap btw)

(Holy crap)

(Holy crap I forgot)

(Ok)

(It's 7/11 today)

(Holy crap)

(Mollie I didn't say 9/11 dammit)

(Ryan that's what I wanna do)

(Frick)

(Oh)

(Why do I only see what I want to
Btw it's cow appreciation day at chick fil a 
Soooo
If we were to dress up like cows
We would get free food
Jus saying)

(You don't even need to dress up then
Jk
I'm sorry)

(YOUUUUUU)

(Couldn't resist)

(BITCHHHHH)

(Mollie no)

(THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I TRY TO SUGGEST SOEMTHING FUN
IM NEVER HAVING NEW IDEAS AGAIN)

(I like it when you think sometimes)

(You killed my garden of thoughts)

(But that setup was too easy)

(Instead of a cow I'll be a vegetable)

(Mmmm)

(That's how I like my girls
Mute and limp)

(And healthy)

(Dirty vegetable)

(And covered in dirt
Mmmm)

(So it sounds like we can grab free slurpees and free chin-fil-a
Chik)

(Exactly)

(Maybe)

(And maybe a cheap movie
All in one go)

(Discount Tuesday)

(Cmon boy)

(The ultimate cheap date)

(I would expect nothing less)

(*more)

(Haha 😂)

(Thank youuu)

(Mmm hmm)

(My second good setup 💁)

(What a great team we make
Haha so the only movie I've ever seen at a drive in was spiderman)

(Like a broken puzzle piece that fits together)

(It might become the second movie I see too)

(Nah
I just jam the pieces together until they fit)

(Haha really?)

(Yeah no kidding)

(Mmm
I do like a forceful man)

(And you like a sweet lil girl)

(Yesss)

(Speaking of which
I am placing my order rn)

(Oh btw papa said we can do it)

(😉 ok)

(Um you mean the movie right?)

(😂 um yes)

(Phew)

(Ryan wtf)

(Haha mollie)

(😂)

(I'm just playing you)

(Wit)

(Alright well this is not going where I intended)

(Wut
Dammit
Playing me to get at my dad? 😂)

(Abort mission)

(What other interpretation did you want 😂)

(Too late)

(Doesn't matter)

(AGHHHH)

(Oh sorry)

(haha
Forcing it
Hey what's our timing?
Boy 
Boyyyyy)

(One sec
Do you really want to do the chik-fil-a thing?
I don't really want to dress up like a cow
And I don't even have anything cow-related to wear 😂)

(Aw boy)

(Ugh fine I'll do it for the story)

(Not even for the story
😂 we can sharpie spots onto white t shirts
Haha we don't have to do anything you don't want to)

(I have a white GTD shirt I can use
And you're gonna be my chauffeur for the day because your sound system is better)

(Yeeeeee)

(Idk 6:15?)

(Haha so timing then? I'm just doing housework rn)

(Wait I don't know
Movie starts at 8:55)

(How far away?)

(Jesus Christ)

(38 minutes
29 miles
Well on the plus side, there's only one turn
😂 take auburn Folsom for 27 miles and then turn left)

(Hello yeah!)

(What about a 7/11 😂)

(*hell
I totally know that route
There's a chick fil a that way too)

(Oh shoot that's right)

(￼)

(Uhhh
I can only think of auburn and sierra college)

(Well that's neat)

(Excellent)

(￼Okay there's our route)

(So the chik-fil-a deal is good until 7pm
I didn't have any good sharpies)

(Oh damn)

(*dont)

(I have a ton)

(Plan?)

(So plan)

(Yes)

(Yeah probably)

(Logistics
You wanna come over and make your shirt orrr?)

(Gimme five minutes to talk with my parents)

(Alrighty)

(Okay well my car has been reserved)

(Send my love)

(So uh can you come to me? I mean I can drive the white one too)

(You mean go pick you up and bring you back?)

(Haha yeah...)

(Ok)

(I can take the white car but my parents like me driving the red one)

(That's fine. I'll get you rn. Is that ok?)

(Uh leave your house at 6:00)

(What?)

(Yeah I think we'll be fine)

(Not now?
Do we have time?)

(Okay fine I need to look presentable)

(Huh?)

(Put on clean clothes and mess with my hair until it looks okay)

(Haha that's understandable right?)

(I'm wearing your shirt covers in dog hair and I've been dancing to musicals in my kitchen for the last hour)

(Yeah...)

(But I guess I can change too)

(The dog hairs
*shudders*)

(There's barely any at all you baby)

(Eh whatever)

(You can come now)

(Yayyy)

(Coming out)

(Which door
Ryan)

(Outside
I see you)

(Creepin on the kids)

(That's what i figured)

(Oh my god she's so pissed
I can't go out anymore
At all
She's done)

(Bye mollie)

(Shittttt)

(And it doesn't help that there's half a wrapper floating around in your car somewhere)

(I am finding that)

(Mollie you need to find that)

(Jesus)

(Or we're completely screwed)

(I know)

(I'm tearing that thing apart)

(So what all happened?)

(I honestly don't even know what would happen to me
God
I don't even know how to fix this)

(You snuck in at 4am...
And then?)

(She knows)

(Well frick)

(She came up just now and freakin layed into everyone 
Like, the whole nine yards
Guilt trip for being irresponsible and not going to be able to be a successful adult
Then yelling at dad for being an enabler that was ruining the kids
Like everything that could be said)

(I'm so sorry)

(It's ok boy, life happens)

(So do you think she "knows"?)

(I don't take anything back
It just kinda sucks)

(Honestly idk)

(Ughhh)

(But I'm being pretty careful to cover up this hickey 
I mean, they all did so much worse in high school
I really don't know what she thinks of me except that I'm worse than her)

(Mollie I'm so sorry
But you'd better find that thing
Or we are totally screw r)

(I know dammit)

(*screwed)

(I'm just so used of this)

(Sadly yes)

(*tired
But I guess that word works too)

(Dammit I wanna be done)

(Honestly)

(My whole life is gonna be like this
Fuck)

(It's okay
You're going far far away
I swear it has to get better)

(But the guilt ryan)

(Bye then)

(Distance doesn't matter 
Ugh I gtg)

(FOUND IT)

(Oh thank god)

(Also
The thing that's wrong with my computer, what exactly will it affect? Just Internet?)

(Idk I think so)

(So theoretically it can do anything that doesn't require retrieving those addresses? So I can still do some work?)

(Like what kind of work?)

(Your internet is buggy
That's all
But I think you knew that... are you just using this as an excuse to talk with me?
How's it hanging miss mollie?)

(Noooooooo)

(Oh right)

(Why would you think I want to talk to you?)

(Silly boy)

(Silly me)

(Obviously you're just tech support)

(Omg)

(Look at jaces story on snapchat)

(Maybe he was in that later white car)

(So how's everything rn?)

(*other
😂)

(Well. I am about to start writing which is good I guess. I found a blackberry stem in my pie which I have mixed feelings about, and mom has not contacted the house at all which is excellent)

(Autistic writing or writing for fun)

(And it sounds like she yelled at everyone which hopefully means that her anger is more general
Than pointed at us
*me)

(Mmm
Okay good
Yeah I think we should cool it and play it safe for a bit)

(Both 😂)

(I'm glad you're back though, but I can't do this every night or nothing will get done and your mom will get pissed)

(Yeah me too)

(We should take Joe to cruise night though)

(That'd be a good thing)

(Oh true that)

(One last thing)

(Good call
Alright you can go back to work, thanks cutie 😉)

(Where'd you find it? 😂)

(😂 down the crack you kept dropping play doh you oaf)

(Ohhh)

(That crack is too easy
Haha it turns out Jace was at screen 2 as well)

(Good thing he didn't see us 😂 not after my disrobing)

(Damn girl)

(1001 is your house number right?
Shit nvm I knew that)

(You are not being discreet in the slightest)

(T)

(Nighty night miss mollie)

(Oops
This isn't in person)

(I'll send you a telegram soon
How's life?)

(Lifing on)

(Oh that's right. It's Thursday)

(Susan kinda made it better for once)

(Please tell me I didn't come up)

(You came up)

(Yeah that'd probably be a positive thing)

(But I didn't tell her anything bad
Don't worry
She thinks you should have dinner with us 
I do too)

(And definitely delayed
We kinda skipped that step)

(Definitely)

(Okay I'll keep that in mind)

(But papa really likes cooking with me and they'd probably appreciate it
So soon)

(And I still need to teach you bridge)

(Mmm)

(I'll just google the rules
I'm a fast learner)

(Good luck)

(Okay maybe that was a lie)

(And maybe bridge is the most convoluted card game ever)

(That's too much pressure mollie)

(My family will form a large part of their opinion of you based on it)

(It's ok I'll tell papa to teach you and I'll help you out before)

(So it's 4 players only?)

(You'll be good at it
I think
It seems up your alley)

(Yeah it's teams of two)

(Omg it's so complex)

(Are you looking at rules 😂)

("Unfinished rubber"
Okay 😐)

(Procrastinatorrrrrrrr)

(I know dammit)

(Haha
Ryan get work done so I can see you sometime 
You could be learning easy bridge from me
Instead of procrastinating at the computer)

(I want to see you again
Fine that'll be my motivation)

(I'm hereeeeee)

(Wtf)

(Home all alone)

(Mollie stop it
I literally can't)

(Except for Audrey and AJ and the gardener 😂)

(All weekend?)

(I know I know hurry up
Get it done
Also I'm home alone all weekend with the kids)

(Yes)

(Also tomorrow's cool car night...)

(Ok now I'm done)

(Yeah okay alright)

(I know
I'm talking to joe about it when he gets home
He'll be super excited
Ok now work
Work so I can see
 You)

(Focusing right now
See you sometime
Screw it
Mollie I'm free
What do you want to do?)

(Hell yeah)

(Am I still on their bad side...)

(Idk
Papa just got home 
You can come here if you want
Or we can meet
Idk)

(Idk)

(I literally took you out until 4am)

(Papa likes you fine)

(I'm sorry)

(Yeahhhh
Even Susan wasn't too hot on that
And I told her it was 2:30)

(I got a little carried away
🙄you're a time suck)

(Oh that's right)

(Dammit)

(The mollie Ryan time coefficient is like 3)

(Where is this quote book?
And is it real?
You can't keep holding onto this forever)

(Ok)

(So it's real)

(I'll tell you it is real)

(Yes)

(Aww that's so cute)

(I'm happy that it's real)

(Shuddup)

(Hang on I'm compiling rn)

(Me too 😊
Ok ok
So for real)

(I'll push my changes in a sec
Then I'll be set)

(Mmm computer talk)

(Maybe you're using it wrong then 😂)

(Really heats up my 
Uhhh
Idk that bottom part of the laptop that always burns me)

(Just kidding haha
So I'm assuming that a movie would be out of the question
Right?)

(Uhh probably)

(Uh right)

(Considering our last one went for five hours
Honestly 
I don't care what we do)

(Even if it's nothing)

(Okay yeah same)

(Like I'd be happy just to go over)

(Just making sure I don't need anything)

(Awww)

(Uhh)

(Nah 😂)

(Unless you wanna do auburn house?
Idk)

(Half of my family is there rn)

(I wasn't sure what you meant 😂)

(Alright I'll just head over in a bit)

(Haha)

(Mollie I feel terrible)

(To me?)

(I really really think your family low-key hates me)

(What
Why?)

(Especially your mom)

(Nah baby don't worry)

(She's so nice in person)

(She's just kinda irritable)

(But then I hear what you say)

(She's a doctor. That's her facade)

(I know I know)

(That's what they do it's ok)

(Okay okay)

(Don't worry about it)

(Find checkers
😂 or scrabble idk)

(Checkers)

(I guess)

(Weak 
Whatever)

(Nvm just do your thing)

(Mollie but you're my thing)

(Then hurry up and get here to do your thing)

(Leaving rn)

(Here)

(Ayyy)

(Mollie there's so many doors)

(Come on in boy)

(Also is it ok if I'm a little shabby)

(I never know which one)

(The front door)

(Okay
Yeah it's fine)

(Get into the front porch)

(I'm in)

(Someone will see you)

(Uh)

(Hey hottie)

(Mollie wtf did you do?)

(Come and get me
Yeaah boiiiii
https://9gag.com/gag/aP9W69Q?ref=ios.s.sms)

(Nothing)

(I dont know how your computer got this messed up)

(Everything is fine over here)

(😑)

(I will fix 
No worry
I will fix
Once I'm done procrastinating)

(Right)

(Right)

(Speaking my language)

(In both cases)

(Trying I make you more comfortable)

(Mmm)

(*to
Jus cooling off the underside of the laptop that inside my head)

(Mollie check your Facebook)

(Uh oh)

(I was trying to compete with you on peak)

(Freakin bring it)

(But I needed a Facebook)

(I'm trying)

(Really?!)

(🙄 yup)

(Awww
I'm your only friend)

(Okay
Looks like you need to connect too
Eh we'll do it later
Unless you're down with me fumbling around trying to walk you through)

(Connect?)

(Haha alright)

(Oh shuddup
I have plenty of friends)

(Yeah goto to peak
And click on a game
And somewhere on its page, between the howto and the start button
, is a button to link friends)

(Wait will you see all my stuff?)

(Mollie I've only done it like 5)

(Cuz you've had a longer time o raise scores
I've only done it like twice
It seems unfair
Not that I'm not brilliant)

(That's not that many more
Whatever
If you're not confident enough that's fine
😏)

(Oohhhhh)

(Alright I'm back home)

(You're gonna get it now)

(Uhhh)

(Haha alright well let me know what your plans are)

(I'm not)

(I'm taking a shower)

(Ok. I'm trying to hurry up)

(No don't worry)

(I'm not in a rush
What are you doing rn?)

(I'm by blue nami with mom still)

(It does)

(Yeah but I thought cats end at 8
*cars
I like cats)

(Cars)

(Yeah you do)

(But don't push it
If don't make it, it's not the end of the world
There's still two more this year
The massive one is beginning of sept.)

(Will we be here?)

(Yeah)

(Like sept. 13)

(Yayyyy)

(Okay okay)

(Also I'm pretty sure we're heading home now
Not exactly sure what that means though)

(If we can leave my house by 7:00, I'd say it's still worth going
Otherwise we'll just wait till next month)

(Ok ok)

(Oh right, and if we just so happen to be in Auburn...)

(On it)

(Righttttt)

(When in Rome)

(Alright I'm home)

(Yeah)

(Honestly Ben if that thins ends maybe we should quickly go to auburn anyway…)

(Let's do it)

(Ok ok)

(Downstairs porch)

(We can't be out late
But I'm changing and hopefully leaving
On my way!
I'm here
Go in?
Boy
Boy
Where are you)

(I'll be down)

(Go in?)

(Holy crap the girl in the background was the girl leaving in the truck)

(￼
They're gone
Sounds like Audrey's friend is here)

(Holy crap)

(Haha)

(Grandpa girl)

(Daddy's daddy's girl)

(Oh baby)

(What's the verdict, daddy-o?)

(Uhhhh)

(That's sad mollie)

(They're gone
It's just me and kids
I need to shower and then I think they'll be asleep
But
I think it can work
If you want
If not I'll probably sit up here and get buzzed)

(Never do it alone
But yeah, just tell me what's up and I'm down
I think you should pick me up from a park and ride though)

(Ryan I've never done it with anyone else)

(￼Frick)

(Yeah probably 
Also the gas lights on so like I can't go very far)

(I need a moment)

(Aw baby it's ok)

(￼)

(We can't all be winners
Only the best)

(Nvm all good
Something's never change
*some things
Okay back to logistics
Timing?)

(Please. You're like a thousand behind. I'm 200)

(Ugh)

(Uhh
Like 20-30 min to shower and stuff
Where do you propose we meet?
Cuz my car is literally gonna be rolling)

(Maybe I'll just park
Wait no that's a dumb idea
Is there somewhere I can walk from?
Like isn't the horseshoe bar one close?)

(Where is that one?)

(Maybe)

(You could park in the dirt pull out at the bottom of my driveway 
It's in the left as you drive up)

(I'm just worried
You're brother will 100% notice my car
100%
Okay
Here
￼
Open maps
And type in park n ride
It'll list all of them sorted by distance
Tell me which one is the closest
It might be boyington
Idk)

(Wtf)

(Uh)

(Mine are like in the Bay Area)

(Is your little blue dot over your house?
In Newcastle at least)

(Yeah it looks like it)

(I'm on google maps so...)

(Lemme see)

(That might be different
It's fine I can check manually)

(Tre)

(Can you make it to DO and back?)

(True
It's definitely apple maps
They're screwy)

(That park n ride is right there)

(Yeah I think so)

(Yeah)

(Is that boyington?)

(Penryn Park n' Ride
3150-3168 Boyington Rd, Penryn, CA 95663)

(I can do that)

(Right next to the 76)

(Ok but I need to shower still)

(Alright sounds good)

(Yeah
Soooo you're gonna have to wait a lil but)

(How long is a shower?
Cause it takes me 10 minutes to get there)

(Give me like 30 total because I need the girls to et out if there's and lay down with joe)

(Alrighty then)

(That should do it)

(I'll just wait until you text me)

(Alrighty boy)

(Alright same)

(I'm excited
Leaving in 5)

But I think I might actually have something good)

(Really?)

(Not yet)

(Send it)

(I like your stories)

(It's not ready)

(The idea's there
Maybe it'll be good
I don't know I was tired)

(That's the best)

(Mmm)

(It's the part of your mind that never gets to talk otherwise 
Send it when it's ready)

(I need a good story)

(If it turns out, I will)

(Mollie
I love life so much
I want you to know that
I don't know, it just clicked when I was driving home
And I decided to miss the turn
I love being alive
I love all of it)

(You know what?)

(I'm so happy we happened)

(Me too
Even when it sucks
To be able to feel it
It's amazing)

(I'm so happy)

(I know)

(Nothing can take the memories away)

(I don't think I would've known that I loved it otherwise)

(I know)

(It's so much easier to feel the warmth
Even the hurt feels so good
So clean)

(Samesies)

(And I love your stupid words)

(Ughghggh)

(So much 
You make me happy)

(Aww
You're gonna make me weep)

(Awww)

(Hey)

(I should've given you peter rabbit
To weep into while I'm gone
He's a good bunny
He's perfect for hugging)

(Uh
You've been blackout drunk for two days in a row. Be careful Mollie. Idk how well your brain's gonna take it if you don't give it time to recover
The whole month that I was drinking, I never threw up or blacked out. So just be careful Mollie. Three days in a row is a lot)

(Ryan we're not doing that 😂)

(Oh phew)

(I don't mind too much
I just like your brain
... a lot)

(Don't worry we're just gonna watch everyone else do that)

(Dammit)

(I like yours too
Also
What emoji really speaks to you
Like)

(If you had to choose one or two to describe who you are)

(I don't want an emoji pillow)

(🙄😂)

(Emoji pillow)

(Yeah you're good)

(?)

(Oh)

(Sorry wrong person)

(I'm so confused)

(🙄😞)

(Answer the question 
Or it's going out to the jury)

(I think that's the wrong kind of Asian eyes)

(😑😞)

(Aren't yours the up kind)

(🙄)

(Alright)

(I like this one a lot though)

(I will take your opinion into consideration)

(😑🙄)

(Maybe those two)

(Natalie does not approve)

(It's like saying "I'm Asian. Whatever")

(We need emojis for your contact lol)

(Oh
Wanna see yours)

(-Natalie)

(￼)

(What
What?!
Yes!
I have emojis

Ryannn)

(You ass)

(Heyyy Natalie)

(You just did that)

(Tell her to slip me a bottle of that sweet potato fluid)

(Fine
We're choosing yours)

(Shove it in the lucky charms box
It'll be discrete)

(Mmmm)

(Mmm)

(Lucky charms and vodka 
Breakfast of champions)

(Then to top it off
Wash that mouth with a bottle of Jack)

(￼)

(Everything makes sense)

(Everything I think of when I think of you ~❤️)

(Except the cow 😂
Whyyy)

(You look like it)

(It's because I'm a coward)

(In the face)

(Right)

(A young calf)

(A fine heifer as they say)

(You made Natalie laugh 
But I'm above that)

(Yay
Tell Natalie I wanna see her again at one point
She's funny)

(She thinks you're funny looking)

(Like you said, a cow)

(So she also wants to see you
Haha)

(It's okay
She looks like one too
And so do you
Fackin caws
The lat of ya)

(FACKIN CAWS)

(Sheeple)

(A bunch of mindless herd animals
Exactly)

(They need you)

(Wait
Uh
Hi

(Ok)

(Sorry new number)

(Now it's mollie again)

(No sorry)

(So you're not the hooker for the party?
Well shit)

(I'm from the party for the hooker)

(…would you be willing to fill in?)

(Since when did I start looking like a baby calf)

(Send pics
I'll judge
Looking for someone who looks a bit like a strapping young bull)

(Is this a new thing?)

(It's the first thing I thought)

(Or have you been repressing this comparison for a long time)

(I'm sorry)

(The first)

(Like way back)

(Baby cow)

(In enviro)

(I'd tap that)

(Wait mollie)

You thought I looked like a frickin cow
Well I guess there's worst things that beastiality

(A calf
A little brown one)

(Okay here's the plan
This place is right next to the State fair
Get four/five people and go to the fair
Spend the night there
Safely
May or may not have cider)

(Cider!!!)

(Mike's Hard Apple Juice)

(CIDERRRRR

Her choice really)

(Mike hawk, he gets wrecked too)

(Okay will do)

(I'm sure she'll come if I can get her to think straight 
Ryan
You can watch us 
😂
Ryan
Listen to the Dear Evan Hansen soundtrack 
Like the songs once you get into it are really deep and relatable
It's good)

(But wouldn't it be better if I just watched it?
Idk how well I can visualize it...)

(You don't need to)

(Lessdoit)

(It tells its own story
Idk I haven't watched it
But when you haven't seen it then the music can really be anything you want
I can give you the premise though so you understand)

(Gimme premise

Don't type out a massive paragraph rn
While you're probably walking)

(I have a little bit while Natalie gets her shoes on)

(SHE HAD HER SHOES OFF??)

(Ohoho)

(*bone)

(Good one)

(Where's my synopsis girl?)

(Wait)

(Mmmm by all means take your time. Those opportunities only grace our presence once in blue moon)

(Once I'm done with this nice breast and hot wiener I'll dish it out to you)

(Alrighty here we go)

(alright I'll listen to it tonight when I get back home)

(Evan falls out of tree. Breaks arm. Everything thinks it's a suicide attempt. He has to go to therapy and write himself letters everyday. Connor finds one letter then commits suicide with letter in pocket. Everyone thinks it's a letter to Evan. Evan in love with connors sister, says he was connors friend to get close to the family. Goes on to forge emails and such to prove friendship and et close to them, etc)

(Thanks mollie)

(Ooh out and about)

(It was for Natalie)

(Fuck)

(Save it)

(I'm sorry

(Replay!)

(I tried)

(Fuck

But my timing was off
So I only pressed the sleep)

(All that screwing around with the pussy)

(￼)

(Pussy
Whoops I wasn't done yet)

(Mmm those strong features)

(Like a bull)

(That's why I gave them to you)

(I didn't know you could do that)

(Mmmm)

(That's so pretty)

(Get on my level)

(Maybe I'll do that today)

(NO)

(Hmpf)

(Ryan

Don't do it
Stay beautiful)

(Because your looks are the only thing holding me down)

(Right right)

(Obviously 
😂)

(Ditto
Fine
But sometime soon)

(😘)

(You know what)

(Good thing we're both so beautiful)

(You can take me
And help me not get a buzz cut
I never know how to describe what I want, so I ask for a buzz)

(You know what)

(What why)

(We can take Natalie
She knows)

(😂  don't let me)

(I have a coupon for a lavish haircut, shampoo and all)

(Let Natalie)

(Ooh Ryan)

(Hahaha)

(I hope your hairdresser is a boy
Or else I'll be jealous)

(Watching someone else treat you lavishly)

(Just imagine mollie)

Covered in suds
Running her gentle fingers through my wet hair

(Hmmm)

(Did it work?)

(Alright
Well good for you
Stupid boy)

(Can't you tell?)

(Uhhh)

(Wait do you see all this?)

(As it comes through?)

(It'll pop out of my printer soon I guess)

(Idk
I'm not home rn)

(Mmm)

(Wtf did you send)

(I'm gonna freak someone in your family out
Good)

(Is it bad?
Mollie
Tell me)

(It might be a little creepy)

(That's kinda pointless right)

(Since it has your address on it)

(I'm gonna see it
Then mail it
Then see it again)

(I wasn't sure where it was coming from)

(Eh I just hope you didn't write anything bad)

(Your printer wasn't my first thought
Lo siento)

(Feedback though? Is the interface too cumbersome?)

(No I think you made it as clear as is possible)

(Okay cool. Well I'm gonna send out this number to a bunch of friends now. And we'll see what happens 😂)

(I'm impressed
And kinda excited)

(I already did 😂)

(Mollie)

(Buy me a cool bottle opener from Santa Cruz)

(Bottle opener? 😂)

(I did haha)

(Haha really?
Ok
Cool as in cool looking or cool as in it's concealed in the bottom of a flip flop?
Also did you see me drumming?😂
Cuz we should do that too)

(What just straight up drumming?
I don't know where to do that)

(I have drums 😂)

(Nah let's do it)

(Idk I just wanna make music it's fun
Nvm don't worry about it 😂)

(I suck at music)

(Samesies)

(But I know audio stuff on computers to loop it and make it sound better)

(All in)

(Awwwww)

(We just need a few piano chords, some drum notes)

(Perfect)

(And some sweet ass auto tuned vocals)

(Lessdoit)

(Maybe the faint twanging of an acoustic guitar in the background)

(Oh hell yeah)

(And perhaps one or two cowbells)

(I have all of those)

(ALL of those)

(Our album cover needs to be a classy black and white photo of us with our wardrobes switched, like the other day)

(And a rebellious glimmer on our visage)

(We're doing this)

(I'll hit up all the record labels today and try to get us signed)

(As soon as I get back)

(Can we also make ice cream?)

(Better yet, send a telegram so they know we're committed to our image)

(I've always wanted to do that. And now that I'm 18, I can buy dry ice)

(Of course)

(Anything you want m dear)

(Mmm)

(You've never made ice cream?)

(Right telegram... old school)

(😂 dude)

(Yeah with ice and salt)

(But it kinda sucks)

(Trueeeeel)

(Mmmmm hot)

(Let's get dry ice 
And make ice cream and smoke and burn off our warts)

(... oh wait nvm
Cold)

(Took the words straight from my thumbs)

(Mmm)

(Ms. Royal Thumbs)

(Did you find that or did I tell you? 😂)

(Uh)

(It was on your computer as the login)

(Oh you)

(You showed me)

(Oh ok 😂)

(Inadvertently)

(Also)

(But you remember everything)

(Sorrrry 🙄)

(Do you know anyone at all in your extended family with thumbs like yours?
I'm just curious what side it comes from)

(Nope)

(What)

(Why do you punish me so?)

(No one knows where they're from)

(*enthuasium?)

(But you go to work
Curb your curiosity)

(*enthusiasm
Frick I spelled it wrong
It was god's gift
Okay back to work)

(Enthusiastic about my thumbs?)

(Hey)

(😂 I guess I like your hands too)

(Hi)

(￼)

(Boy it's ok)

(Yeah)

(I told you that)

(Hang on
No one can even go tomorrow
We were thinking Wednesday and michael really wants you to go)

(Really?!)

(Yeah idk why)

(I'm coming back tomorrow)

(But he keeps asking about you 😂)

(Awww michale)

(So if that's all good, I think Scott's good too)

(Michael

(Really?!)

(If you wanna bring more people, that'd be fun too 😂)

(Awww

(We're just gonna carpool)

(I don't even care man)

(Yeah probably more guys like Kyle, Conner can't make it tho
But yeah, I literally only have guy friends rn)

(That's ok)

(I just don't know how you feel about hanging out with 4 or 5 guys 🙄
Just looking out for you)

(Five guys one chick)

(But I'll run it past them if Wednesday work...)

(That's exactly what I like)

(*works)

(😉)

(Okay I'm down for most things)

(Ayyy I texted papa jus now so we'll see)

(But not that)

(😒
Okay
Looks good)

(Don't you want to experience true brotherhood?)

(Mmm)

(😂)

(Teamwork
A true bonding experience)

(Teamwork makes the dream work son)

(How late does the fair go until?)

(Cause honestly, if we're going I wanna stay till the end)

(Late)

(Okay so... we're good?)

(Yes
I agree
Pretty late
There's a lot)

(I think
As of now it's Scott, Michael, myself, and maybe Kyle, and maybe you)

(Yeah that sounds good)

(Eh don't worry)

(Papa hasn't responded I'll prompt him)

(If not, I'll just hang out without you 🙄)

(Noooo)

(Yes)

(If not I'll just sneak out
But
I still wanna have band and cooking day)

(I was serious)

(Me too)

(-banana
-dancing
-cross-dressing
-lake wildwood
-drunk writing)

(Oh...)

(-drunk scrabble)

(It makes me kinda sad that there's so much
But we're doing every single thing on that list)

(It's ok)

('cept dancing)

(A lot of these are spur of the moment)

(That's okay)

(*drunk dancing)

(I'm fine as long as I don't think)

(Ryan I danced all over the place crazy tonight until Natalie's drink dad came out and danced with me)

(Yup)

(😂I'm surprised you didn't get a video
It feels so good when you don't think and just let yourself go wild 
Anyways
A lot of these things can be accomplished together 
We have time)

(I checked
So we both go on the 18th
Tomorrow's the 18th)

(I'm oddly satisfied with the fact that we both leave on the same day)

(Um so I didn't realize the dates)

(It feels right
No one gets left behind 
Though some stupid part of me had hoped that you could see me off idk
But this is good)

(But it might be different 🙄
￼
The 18th was their estimate
But it could really be anywhere in that range)

(Woah)

(Yeah... more than likely the same day)

(Still weird)

(Idk if we'll see each other off
I'll be driving off early morning
Or the night before)

(I'll be flying out that day. Not sure what time though)

(Can we not)

(Ugh let's stop)

(Yeah me too)

(This is making me really sad)

(It's making me really sad)

(I just want to go to bed happy tonight)

(Same)

(I love you, Ryan. I hope I get to see you tomorrow.)

(Me too)

(Thanks for choosing me)

(Thank you so god damn much
I love you so much
So fucking much)

(God that feels so good)

(Me too)

(Ugh I'm smiling now)

(Oh gosh

("Oh gosh")

(Mollie next time we do it)

(😂 that's exactly what I needed 
Alright I need to sleep boy)

(I'm saying that to you...
All right
Nighty night miss mollie)

(That would be perfect)

(Mollie don't respond now. But I just had a realization)

(Nighty night)

(Haha but you keep me grounded in this weird way. Because whenever you leave I stay up until 5:00 am and sleep past noon
When you're actually here, I have a reason to wake up earlier)

(I'm taking care of you, college only supports certain lifestyles 😂)

(Eh since I'm still up, let's add hijacking the drive-in radios to our bucket list)

(And you doing your thing while I program it 🙄)

(Oh hell yeah)

(I feel like that's something I would, of all things)

(Glad you remembered 😏)

(Okay Mollie, what's the plan? Are you back on Thursday or today or what?)

(Driving back rn)

(Yayyy)

(What's the eta?
Don't crash

(Any time)

(Carpool? 😬)

(Pleasseeee)

(Alrightttt)

(Also
What's your website?)

(Yes)

(Uh I took it down yesterday 😂)

(What?!)

(http://rmj.us)

(I'm working on a way better version
So there's nothing there rn)

(Awww)

(Haha)

(Papa really wanted to see it)

(Did you him yours?
I mean some links are good
One sec
http://rmj.us/tutorials/gpg-part1.html
Don't judge
I wrote that as a sophomore, but only kept it around cause people actually found it useful
All the links at the top except the "Home" one)

(Ugh I remember this one)

(Yeah I have a lot more...)

(Sooooo much stuff
Mmm)

(But anyways
I'm revamping it to look really really good
Like professional level
Did you show him yours?)

(Yes 😂)

(I'm just curious)

(He likes it)

(Yeah I re-read some of the paragraphs)

(We need to rework some sentences that sound awkward
It doesn't flow as much as I'd like)

(You freaked him out)

(Mollie I'm so pumped. We're gonna get paid to write. I'm ready to put in the work to get hired. Even if you decide not to write, I'm gonna do this regardless. I'm ready to dump a ton of hours into it. I need to write samples like every night)

(What how)

(Ugh damn ok me too)

(We'll look like one person but have the work output of two 😂)

(It's kinda fun 😂 hopefully it doesn't blow up)

(Nah it's worth it)

(Haha)

(Two sardonic teenagers trying to hack it)

(I'm soooo excited)

(I don't think you understand)

(*hacking it)

(We can write every genre)

(Haha
Ok ok
This could be your break from computer engineering 😂)

(I don't care
Yeah haha
I can write about blockchains too 🙄
But you were saying...
I freaked him out?
Also if you swing by earlier, I can fix your computer in about 30 minutes)

(Oh hellll yes)

(Mmm right)

(*i can fix it
With your supervision 
Haha a little)

(Yeah I'll let you drive)

(He was all like "where did this kid learnt his shit" all quietly to himself)

(I'll just supervise but it's all you)

(Like awed)

(Haha 😂)

(That makes me happy)

(Honestly might have boosted your image around here 😂)

(Ahaha)

(Yeeee)

(Don't get a big head)

(He hasn't seen nothing yet)

(Did he know that I got suspended?
Does anyone know?)

(Uhhhh)

(Don't go around bragging  tho)

(So before we were anything 
I might have mentioned it)

(I do a little)

(That's how you get caught...)

(Mostly just quietly to joe)

(Wait what did you tell your family?)

(That's why he likes you maybe 😂 you're like an idol)

(Before we were a thing.. what did you say?)

(Uhhh)

(Haha)

(I just brought up that one of my friends got suspended for hacking into the school system and messing with the votes and stuff 
Ifk
Papa thought it was great)

(Jesus Christ
Does he know who...
I thought it was pretty funny too. Like everyone did, except the VP)

(It was 😂)

(So he knew the whole time)

(Don't worry, you get all the credit
Haha)

(Yeahhhh)

(😂 omg haha)

(It's just different seeing it I think)

(Whatever)

(What do you mean?)

(Your site)

(Oh)

(Frick
That needs to way better
I've done so much more in two years
Dammit

(Well he was already impressed so now out can really blow him away I guess 😂)

(Mmmm good

(Yeeeup)

(Yeeeeeee)

(Alright girl

(Well damn)

(Someone in my house has a fine pair of white thigh highs now)

(Well shit)

(Mmmm
Who could possible want them?
😂)

(Um
It's probably not Audrey who'd open a package right?
And definitely not Joe...
So um
Yeah)

(No no)

(Uh maybe idk)

(Everyone in my house has motive 
But who really has the means?
Hmmm
Maybe something happened to it)

(Okay mollie I need to crash)

(Haha nvm ok)

(Ugh mollie I miss you already)

(Nighty night
Sleep normal for once)

(That's bad isn't it
Frick what's wrong with me
Okay sorry see you tomorrow maybe)

(No you're just human it's ok)

(Oh sorry)

(I always miss you
Glad it's mutual 
Someeeebody needs to pick it up on peak
Also I need my computer today
I can't keep doing all this online stuff on my phone it sucks)

(Does 2:30 work with you?)

(Huh?)

(Kinda feeling the same)

(Oh to meet up?
Yeah probably 
Ugh I wanna see you
I'm having a bad day
So maybe you don't wanna see me 😂)

(It's all right)

(Like you don't want to see me 😂)

(Nonono)

(I do)

(Haha)

("Working at home by 2:30"?)

(Ok well I'll probably be working at home by 2:30
So just let me know
I just wanna play or something idk 😂
I just want to have fun and not have my fuckin head hurt every day
Ugh
Ok 
Sorry)

(So like you're free up until then or after then?
I know I know)

(Uhhh I will have returned home then and begun to clean out the garage)

(Also Scott sent a postcard from Europe. And finally, after 45 days, it showed up)

(😂 so maybe mine didn't get lost)

(Awww)

(Okay well what do you want to do?)

(That would be nice)

(I don't want to interfere with your chores)

(Literally just fool around and play games or dance or make something idk)

(Yeah that'd be good for us)

(I don't really know)

(Where's that bucket list when I need it)

(Exactly)

(🙄 sure)

(Haha I know it
😂 apparently I'm the one with the memory)

(Okay girl, you tell me what you want and I'll be there. 
My house or yours?)

(Awwww you know what I want to hear)

(Uh let's hold off on that one)

(Uhhhh
Idk 
I feel like screwing around at your house is easier but I feel like my house is a safer bet
I also get more work done that way
It should just be Audrey and AJ around rn
Maybe Papa on and off
Also maybe you should bring those tapioca balls to satiate my sister 😂
And anything else oh might want
*you
We can take our band pic 😂)

(I need to get in the right mindset
Okay so I'll bring your laptop and tapioca pearls
Did you ever find the socks? 😬)

(Tuns out)

(Yayyy)

(I have until tomorrow
To get them for sure
😂 so we might be safe)

(I'm glad there was no embarrassing confrontation
You know, you could have just shipped it to the store and picked it up there right?
At least I think so. Idk about 3rd party vendors)

(That wasn't an option 😂)

(Right)

(Just hurry up and do your thing so you can come over here)

(Sounds like I might have dinner plans, sorry)

(Wait uh dinner plans?)

(Not with you)

(But I'm still coming over)

(I'm confused now)

(Just come over)

(Okay whatever I'll be there in 15-20 min)

(It's later
Don't worry about it)

(Hurryyyyyy)

(On my way)

(Finally)

(🙄)

(Here)

(So the front right?)

(Just waltz in mdear)

(Mollliiieee)

(Mollie mollie mollie
Wtf do I do)

(Oh right)

(scandalousyouth.com)

(Uh
Whatever you want?
I'll come get you)

(Sorry)

(Shut up)

(Weak)

(Mollie I wrecked myself in that group chat)

(Weaklkkkkk
Look
Hey guys, I was already talking to Natalie about this but I want to find a weekend when everyone's around for my birthday up in wildwood. You aren't the only people who'll be invited just the most important 😂 just let me know if you're for sure gone any time or if you leave for college soon so I can plan 





Also it sounds like we might be able to go up there without parents if timing works out…
Ok sounds like Bree leaves the 31 for a couple of days
Anything else?
Guys the weekend of august 4 my grandfather offered to be up there to drive boats as long as we don't bother him or make him cook
For the record)

(Haha sorry
I just finished running and I was so tired and confused)

(Rekd)

(I don't want to make you feel bad)

(😂 haha dumb bitch
July is pretty much done 😂
Haha how was it?)

(But it was really really fun 😂
There was this massive pile of rocks that we sat on for an hour
And we just sat there talking and throwing rocks at this wooden beam
Then it got really dark and we had to sprint out of the canyon at top speeds
How was the garage?)

(Noooooo)

(Yeah and the creepy drunk guy at 7/11)

(Dammit
I missed solid bro bonding time
Ughhh
Frick)

(Awwww)

(Did you sushi at least?)

(I did not sushi)

(Mmm)

(I cooked everyone dinner)

(It'd be ironic if it was sushi)

(It was a bomb ass dinner but still)

("Mollie you didn't cook this Salmon through")

(😂 they get nervous when I make that)

("It's sushi don't worry about it")

(😂 I just make fish and decide it's sushi after)

(Pretty much)

(Ugh salmon sounds so good)

(Haha okay)

(Also
I asked papa about dinner and he really wants to teach you to cook something and play bridge with him again 😂
Just a heads up)

(I think he likes being dad)

(I really like your dad)

(He's so chill)

(Yeah he's kinda seen it all I think 😂)

(Mmm I feel a bit guilty tho. If I didn't come over, you would've been able to clean the garage)

(Anyways. Saturday would probably be a good night for mom but idk what you're planning
Also I wanna go to the lake soooo)

(And go to sushi
Sorry 😐)

(And run)

(Yup)

(Me too)

(It's ok)

(But yeah)

(If you didn't come over I wouldn't have gotten off)

(Lake sounds awesome)

(Ugh)

(And dinner sounds cool)

(It is)

(And normal for once)

(😂 that's the thinking)

(Ugh nooo)

(Alright I'm getting in the shower)

(I just got back
Fine)

(Omg I'll be back 😂)

(Oh yay)

(And we can talk about computers and cooking and anything you want)

(Can you at least respond to the group chat
And make me look cool)

(Oh right)

(Not that I need the help)

(Ryan shut the fuck up)

(Screw you too)

(I got you)

(❤️❤️❤️)

(Oh wait nvm)

(Already did that today
Some people just can't handle that multiple times)

(You wouldn't know about me since you've never gotten me there once 🤗)

(Pssh nah)

(God some people just can't handle instructions 
Ok ok everyone 
Opinions? Thoughts?
Most of you will be invited up to the lake multiple times I would like to point out
Too much?)

(I get it
I'll just use your drug habits as a scapegoat
Mollie just give me two hours, don't rush me, and you'll finish)

(Always the drugs with you)

(I'm pretty sure I could manage that)

(Two hours?
You can't 
That feels like a long time to only focus on me)

(I'm not so sure it's a you problem though I think it's mostly me)

(Yeah those mirrors really got you going huh 🙄)

(Idk
Maybe I'm into something and don't even realize it 
And I'll found out once I'm in my thirties and married with kids)

(Hahaha
Or with kids
And not married)

(That's not even what I meant by mirrors 😂)

(You never know mollie)

(But I did like that)

(You're reckless)

(Haha)

(Thanks)

(Mmm)

(I'll go the independent way
Raise my kids with my rules only)

(And a lesbian lover on the side)

(I'd believe it)

(Wait what did you mean by mirrors
And also that's kinda why I showed you the camera... 😂)

(…what)

(The live preview is like a mirror that works for any angle)

(Oh my god Ryan)

(Hahahaha 😂)

(How long have you been thinking thsi?!)

(Hey I'm just trying to satisfy my lover)

(Holy vrap 
*crap)

(Not that long idk)

(Awww)

(I didn't even know it could do that until a couple of weeks ago)

(Saying that reminds me of those birds that collect straws and stuff to get a mate)

(Mmm)

(So sweet
In a weird way
😂 I can't rn)

(But be blunt with me
Would that do the trick?
I'm a little confused as to what you want)

(Uhhhh)

(Ohhh I see)

(Ok don't judge
Like
Watching the actual thing
But I'm not that sure because I think that's what I'm used to seeing in porn
Which I would only see if I was already excited
So it might be biased info
Does that make sense?)

(Okay yeah there might be some bias
But that's why I thought
So if we pointed it at
... uh
... our stuff)

(Yeahhhh)

(Honestly, we just yank out the SD card and there's no risk of recording anything)

(Seee that's the thing 
It feels kinda wrong)

(It's fine haha
If that's your thing
As long as I don't have to beat you
Or lick your scalp idk)

(Or lick my stuff)

(Haha)

(😂)

(Licking is fine
It's just "penetrating"
My tongue is sooo short 😬
I meant 😐)

(Haha. The only Asian thing about you 😂)

(Hey idk. Not like your tongue is any longer)

(Ryan Jacobs you are such a little sweetheart I can't handle it)

(What)

(Is that a challenge?)

(Uhhh)

(See who can stick their tongue further up an orifice challenge? 
😂😂😂)

(I'm game
But not my orifices please
I think all of them are off limits for me 😂
Sorrry)

(😂 good to know)

(*shudders*)

(So I don't accidentally give you the 'ol reacharound)

(No
No reacharound
God no)

(That's what everyone says before they try it)

(Okay)

(Haha
Ok don't send anything nasty for a min I'm gonna talk to my family 
Innocent)

(Mollie I love our no-touching policy and our firm resistance to anything sexual in the slightest. I'm glad we haven't kissed yet
Your parents and family are the most wonderful people I know, second only to yourself
I'm glad we decided to wait not only after marriage, but beyond death as well
Okay I'm going to chow down on a frozen banana. See ya)

(Ohhh damn I could go for one of those)

(Mmm hmm)

(And we will die having only ever held hands, briefly that night at the fair
Grandfather doesn't count
I think the weekend of the 3rd or 4th is what everyone in my house is leaning towards you guys
I think that's the only time I can really guarantee there won't be cousins or something up there
The fourth
Noah idk just that weekend)

(Sounds delightful babe)

(That banana sounds delightful babe)

(Too bad it's gone)

(I'd love to coat it)

(Whoops)

(Aw you didn't save any for me? 😢)

(Hnnnngg)

(Guess I have to do everything by myself 
Hnrrg)

(Like fixing computers 😂)

(Wait so it isn't fixed)

(Apparently my plan to get close to tech support backfired 
Since none was given)

(I don't think so)

(Fine)

(I knew I should've named it when I got it)

(Bring it by sometime
And I'll try my hardest
I'll go 100%)

(Mmmm)

(🙄 right)

(Go 100%
Then we can look at my computer right?
Ryan I can honestly just take it in 😂)

(Mollie I'm not one to give in
Except when trying to climb walls
Maybe then
Just then)

(And go down)

(Hahaha)

(Just then
Ok I'm done 😂
Haha you can try
And leave me something funny on the computer 
Or maybe don't 
That's too much power)

(If I wanted to, I would have already
Mollie are you sure I satisfied you 🙄)

(Wut?)

(Yeah haha)

(Today?)

(Women are never satisfied Ryan)

(Whatever)

(Cmon 
Tho I am practically a dude I guess…)

(Damn you all)

(At least I get off)

(That's all that matters)

(Quotebook right there)

(Mmm hmm)

(Haha
Right right
I only do this to get odd
Off
Good. I didn't want you)

(Uninvited)

(Now we're in sync)

(Finally)

(We can't have any racial mixing)

(Let's just get you to have one next time)

(Especially with grandfather there
That fuckin bitch
Oh shit is exactly what you'd be saying when he saw you son
Haha true
Oh shit true
Let's try to sync up orgasms next 😂)

(That sounds great to me)

(Ugh)

(Arduous and possibly impossible 
But very intriguing 
I'll wear the socks 😂)

(I wouldn't last then)

(I feel like at least one to be safe idk)

(Mutual masturbation 😩)

(I'd rather have it than not
Idk what's the consensus?
Shuddup you can't either
I only have drug hookups
Prove it and bring it 
Exactly 
Then you can just watch me 
What he said?😂
Pussy
Just get sick and keep going)

(Gettin it done together)

(Only the sweetest)

(Mmm
K I'm falling asleep
Sweet dreams 😘)

(Goodnight Mollie
￼Not that it's a competition or anything
￼
￼
￼)

(Now I feel a little threatened)

(Ugghhhhhhh)

(Alright then, fine
Enjoy this while it lasts
￼￼
I hope you enjoyed it
Those were just two thy I wasn't already beating you on too
Ok guys this coming weekend won't work because they have their gourmet group up there
So just let me know what's up
That's what I was thinking. I think the lake is good but it's just people's schedules 
Just tell me when and I'll run it by 
Ok I'll see what I can do
Damn you all and your orientations 
Why do you have to be achievers)

(At least we're driving each other to greater heights and all that)

(Should be)

(Still doesn't glorify the fact that I'm losing 😐)

(Mmmhm)

(You are indeed)

(Yeah and you also have less extreme IQs on average)

(It's ok, girls have a higher iq on average anyways 💁
Good job chick fil a)

(Your wings are kinda clipped by your sex)

(Less retards)

(Ughhh)

("Fewer on average"
But I'm not average boyyyyy)

(Grammar
Whatever
I'll beat you)

(Mmhmmmm)

(Uhh)

(You had your chance
Also unlimited replays might I add)

(You stick it to her)

(￼￼)

(I thought that's what was happening when I texted everyone earlier 💁
This one it's taken
By a rich old gourmet food group
It would 
Ok ok
So we drive up Friday, spend the night, spend Saturday night
Probably
It's only like 40 min away it's not far
Uhhhh that might work
I have to check with grandma 
To make sure there's no cousins 
Tickets still available?
Awww)

(Rekt)

(Just wait)

(Wait why isn't your mom working?)

(Enjoy it while it lasts
I still have to double check that it's ok
But I think that might work
Honestly whoever can't go I'll just bring up another time)

(You said dinner at 5:00
But it's a weekday)

(It's Friday)

(Ohh)

(No work Friday)

(Hmm)

(*no patients)

(I see)

(Always wit)

(Okay)

(Work)

(And sometime we need to focus on work
I want that so bad)

(Yes me too I've been thinking about it but my freakin computer doesn't work)

(We have until August 1st before I have to put in $144 to keep that site up)

(And I'm doing that
Sorry)

(I hate that thing)

(We have until the 1st)

(What?)

(We're on a trial)

(Frick I'll have to take it in I guess)

(Can I have another crack at it?)

(Ugh
Work)

(Please?)

(If you do it soon then yes you may)

(You could drop it off tonight...)

(I could)

((Only a drop off))

(Hmmm)

((Only))

(I won't even see you in person)

(Right)

(I'll just leave it with stumpy)

(She can take care of it)

(Maybe you can say hi to the boys)

(Then leave)

(And not socialize at all)

(And watch the first 20 minutes of my stupid euro video)

(Cuz we're not friends)

(Right)

(Right)

(Mutual friends)

(Right)

(3 half-whites at your service)

(I know you don't associate well with us)

(I generally disapprove of your origins yes)

(Hahaha alright)

(But your people do have their uses
I guess
Dammit Ryan my internet is crapping out 
Send me a pic of our brainmaps compared I can't load it)

(Mines better
Just a forewarning)

(Shut up)

(￼)

(Hey it could all change idk)

(I just whooped your ass in like three games boy)

(Maybe you'll finally be better)

(Whaaa)

(HA

Dumb bitch)

(Who'd you show the brain map 😂

Cause it just puts you in poor light haha)

(Just me)

(Oh)

(I see)

(Cuz I'm petty and insecure)

(Mmm)

(And fuckin coming for you)

(I know it)

(Haha
Insecurity drives passion
Fuel for success
That's why I'm here)

(Along with my unknown rage)

(Yeah you're cool)

(Mmhmmm
To fuel my insecurities 😂
Thansk

Or do I need to wait?
What's the dealio 
Emilio

(You can drop by for a quick sec
And say hi)

(Am I interrupting guy stuff?)

(Uh it depends on how long you intended on saying)

(Do I need to come later?)

(Staying
If you wanna see me for like an hour or so of time, you can swing by after 9:00 haha
Otherwise you can stop by
Idk
We're just hanging out and planning stuff)

(Ugh well now I do)

(They'd probably be glad to see you haha)

(Just tell me what you want)

(Uh yeah do it)

(Now?)

(Whenever)

(I'll be here a while)

(Michael you're a true pal)

(Haha it's fine)

If that's a better day for people
Noah we're gonna be celebrating your birthday too 😂✌️
That means we only make sissy drinks that day
Your choice)

(But of course)

(No one noticed?)

(Or are you gonna hear about it tomorrow...)

(Not as far as I know)

(Mmm okay)

(Well keep me posted about tomorrow)

(As long as you're around boy)

(Hey)

(Unless I decide to run away to the lake
In which case you will also be alerted)

(Hi)

(So)

(Um

We'll see what happens)

(What Ryan)

(Yeahhhh)

(In the head?)

(But in five minutes idk)

(Yeah)

(Not sad?)

(Hang on gotta put on my pjs)

(Awww pj boy)

(Normally I drink before getting sad)

(But idk)

(Oh)

(I'm in a fun mood)

(Sorry)

(Wait nvm)

(Dammit I wish I was there)

(I get sad before drinking)

(Yeah)

(So idk if I'll be sad)

(That's what I thought)

(Okay it hit me)

(Eat)

(Dammit)

(That collects the cap)

(Trash

(Good for them, getting their population under control)

(Debating about lotion or not)

(And you went in there and took full control of your sexual health)

(No mollie)

(Like an adult male
A fornicating adult male)

(That's exactly what I'm avoiding
Or wait
Is fornicating just the act of doing it?)

(You don't know bitch)

(Jesus and you let me emasticate too)

(I can't believe I'm fornicating with you)

(Did you look that one up?)

(Just btw)

(But you should do it more 
😏

(I can't see you tomorrow)

(What why?)

(Cause I got absolutely nothing done today)

(And I promised my dad stuff)

(What are you even doing for your dad?)

(That's not what I said 😂)

(And ok. I will not contact you at all tomorrow
That's my Xander day anyway)

(Don't get too high)

(That's not what I'm doing)

(And I really want to vent. Maybe sometime later ugh. I'm doing crappy software work that I hate cause he's not good enough)

(Ohhh shit)

(But he's so condescending)

(And I hate working with him)

(People get more condescending the less power they feel like they have)

(I'm sorry that I don't have a degree. But I don't need that to be good)

(So shut up and let me write the code correctly
Software is not your gig
Okay I'm done)

(And you're a good talent tap that he can pay less for and still get results from)

(It's ridiculous)

(I'm sorry that sucks ass)

(I know)

(Ryan that's like why people bully other people, it's just cuz they have their own self worth problems so they mirror it in others)

(Like it sounds egotistical I know. But I literally graduated at the top of my class and was voted the smartest kid by the class of 2017. Surely I deserve a little respect and more than $10/hr)

(It makes them feel better)

(Eh whatever)

(I know I get it)

(Parent work sucks)

(I know)

(And you know haha)

(Ughhhh)

(Mmm)

(La vida 
You should listen to hotel California 
It's one of y favorite songs 
It just came on the radio it's so chillin)

(I'm sorry about your work. I know it's stressful and crappy)

(I learned the word "coda" from that song)

(That's life kiddo)

(At least for know)

(Yeah I know)

(Now)

(Haha)

(I'll get out of it)

(The faster learning he's ever done)

(Like I already get paid more by other people)

(I've already got other people who want me dammit)

(Ryan you're gonna be fine)

(I just feel guilty)

(Tell him you can't because you took another project)

(Cause I'm the only one who can work for that cheap)

(I know
I know)

(So I can't bail)

(Why are you working for him?)

(Because he can't afford $80k/yr for a real programmer)

(Does he need it or are you just convenient?)

(Yeah he needs it
He's trying to build a product
And personally I think it's a crappy idea but he's too stubborn
Whatever
I don't want to vent anymore)

(I'm sorry)

(It's just going to aggravate me more)

(That's a shitty situation)

(Mmm hmm)

(Mmmmm)

(Mmm)

(Play my song)

(Take some deep breaths)

(Mmmm)

(Ahhhhh
So creamy)

(Try to go to bed at a reasonable time)

(Oh so cold)

(I'm getting up at 7am tomorrow)

(Yeah!)

(Starting a new schedule)

(That's the plan 😂)

(I'm not but I am going to bed at midnight)

(That's why I bought that 5 hour energy stuff)

(So wen you fall asleep, think of me)

(Mmm)

(Oh no
Ryan)

(You bought that?)

(I'll chug that in the morning)

(Ryan that's stuff is not good for you)

(6am baby)

(No)

(Ohhh)

(Sip it
It hits hard)

(And you're not used to caffeine)

(Something you know about)

(Ryan don't die)

(Oh god)

(Mmmm)

(Don't kill yourslef
That can mess people up
You're not that tolerant)

(I'm just "sensitive"
It's okay)

(Yeah like some kids are "sensitive" to peanuts)

(Hahahaha 😂)

(Mm hm)

(Yeah fair point
I'll be fine)

(Ryan)

(The bottle says half for medium energy and full for maximum)

(Start with like half
Or a quarter
On the first day)

(See?)

(Fine)

(Half
Or a quarter first)

(But I need to make sure that I'm rockn' and rolln' nice and early)

(So do it early)

(Mmm goodnight mollie)

(You got this
Now go to sleep
You've got a lot of rockn and rollin ahead of you)

(Sleep well)

(Talk to Xander tomorrow 😂)

(Yes)

(I want to experience getting high once before going to LA)

(Make it happen please)

(Haha I can get it)

(Yayyy)

(But I'm supposed to do it with him)

(Fine whatever)

(It's been a planned 
But I'll get you some too)

(Guess I won't be your first)

(Sorry)

('Night)

(First come first serve is my motto 💁
Sweet dreams ryan, I'll take care of it)

(I'm really bad at this whole "bedtime" thing
Goodnight
Frick I'm still up.
Mollie I don't even get tired until 6-6:30ish. So I guess when I sleep in until 2pm, that's still like 7 hours of sleep.
Whatever the caffeine will kick me hard tomorrow 😂
I'm gonna write you something then I'm going to attempt sleep again
Mollie, it's lonely nights like these that kick me into this steely realization of how much you mean to me. I wish you were here with me right now. So I could lean up against you, under the covers, and rub my cheek against yours. And hear your gentle breathe in my ears. We could be together for one night, without worrying about our parents or who's sister is going to stumble forth when the sun rises. For once, I could sleep how I normally do: shirtless, entangled in my sheets. Not like those other nights: fully clothed, lain neatly atop the bedspread. Afraid of getting too close to you. Because I was worried that someone might see.

Right now, no one is awake but me. There is no one to talk to or interact with. Literally everyone I know is asleep. You're asleep. My family's asleep. My friends are asleep. Everyone's gone. But me. And I kind of enjoy that feeling in this weird way. The pressure's off during the night. No judgement. No witnesses. I can write to you without anticipating a response. I can code. I can read.

It's only around 2:00, when the sadness hits. And the loneliness. And the urge to drink away my feelings. But I do that to myself. I force myself to stay up late so I can finally be alone. And then it hits me hard, and I bitch about it. So I can't complain too much about something I do to myself.

Anyways, I'm not too sure what the point of all of this was. I just felt like writing. And so I kept going. And going. I think I  kept digressing from my original thoughts because I'm still scared to admit them.

Mollie Harmon. I love you so much. I hope that you'll live a good life. I hope that everything will work out. And I hope that somehow, 50 years down the line, you'll still remember me.

Also maybe every once in a while, we could talk on the phone before bed. I think 30 minutes of voice is a million times better than 30 blips of text.

Your boy,
Ryan)

(Oh Ryan I love you so much it scares me)

(I'm vegged out on this beanbag rn listening to music)

(Thank you
Did you wake up today?)

(I didn't fall asleep until 6:30ish haha. And I got up at 8)

(Ughhh)

(Noooo)

(Ryan
You're just vegging out all day?)

(Course bit)

(All day while I'm here alone? 😂)

(*not)

(Haha)

(Whaaa)

(I thought this was Xander's day)

(It is)

(I'm supposed to be working but my brain is not cooperating rn)

(Jut later
And not at someone's house)

(Cuz you didn't sleep)

(Mmm)

(Mmmhmmm)

(Awww)

(Haha)

(I'm missing you more than usual rn)

(Awwww)

(I just feel like sleeping and cuddling)

(I'm sorry)

(I said I wouldn't talk to you)

(I can't)

(But you could if you wanted here
But only until like 2)

(I have an interview at 3)

(I want to)

(I know)

(But I can't)

(I'm sorry)

(Good luck)

(I hope you fail honestly)

(I shouldn't have texted you I couldn't help it)

(😂 so you can write with me)

(Honestly I hope so too)

(I hope the decide they don't want anyone for just the summer)

(I'm doing stuff today actually)

(Really?)

(My goal is $50 today)

(Less go
Idk if I'll hit it)

(Ooh writing stuff?)

(It's pretty ballsy)

(Looking or did you find something?)

(Nah I'm just gonna go for it)

(Shoot
K I guess I'll look too)

(Uhhh)

(Content mills are easy but the pay is crap)

(You need to find someone who wants it)

(Like $10-20 an article)

(Ohh right right)

(It's okay this is just the beginning
Then we move onto jobs that are like $100 an article
Hopefully)

(Ew)

(Plus who's gonna hire a girl for 6 weeks?)

(Haha)

(Most jobs are minimum two months)

(We'll see)

(But I guess mom n' pop shops can take short term
Idk
I'm just rambling cause I'm tired
I made guacamole for breakfast and just ate that by the spoonful
So I've got that going for me)

(Haha me too)

(Oh haha)

(Ugh that sounds so good
I'm gonna go eat that and a fudge pop
Mmm)

(I found out what was wrong with my phone 😂
Jesus Christ)

(What?)

(Mollie wtf)

(Too much porn?  😏)

(No)

(Haha what was it)

(My phone was stolen)

(I think
That's what it looks like 😂
I guess that's what you get for buying it half price from guy of Sacramento Craigslist)

(Wait)

(*off)

(What)

(Sssshhh)

(Oh god)

(Don't tell)

(You own a stolen phone)

(It's not really stolen)

(Holy shit)

(😂 did they fix it?)

(It just looks like it was stolen)

(Wait no
Okay it wasn't stolen from a person
It was stolen from t mobile
If you want to be technical
Nope)

(Someone shoplifted it?)

(I just bought a new phone)

(No
Okay here it comes)

(What?!)

(So basically when you sign a phone contract, you are taking out a loan for the phone that you pay each month. E.g a $60/month plan gives you service and an iPhone SE or whatever paid off in two years. After two years, the phone is paid off, and it's yours. Until then, the service provider technically owns it)

(So what this guy did, I think... he bought a contract. Sold the phone for $200, it's worth about $400. Then he either shredded the contract or reported the phone stolen to collect insurance
It's called insurance fraud
So if I walk into t mobile they'll just take the phone, cause technically this guy stole it from them 😂)

(Ohhhh)

(Uh well it's automatic)

(Haha that's pretty smart
How did they catch on?
Oh)

(The plan expired)

(If you let your contract lapse for two payments, they lock the IMEI)

(Right ok)

(So that's about right
Considering I bought it mid April)

(Ohhh)

(But letting your contract lapse looks really bad. So I'm guessing that he just reported it stolen, which you can do, to collect insurance and a new phone)

(Haha I was kinda right
You didn't pay the bill
So to speak)

(So new phone + my $200 is a pretty good deal to him)

(Holy shit)

(I knowww...)

(That's a great idea)

(I could report him to t mobile for fraud
And they'd probably go through with it
But I think I'm just going to sell the phone and move on with it 😂)

(Mmm)

(Apparently this happens quite a few times.)

(But then you get a hit on you)

(Nah)

(Woahhhh)

(They go for like $150-$250 online)

(You're gonna do the same thing?!
Ryan Jacobs)

(So I might actually make money on this)

(Holy shit)

(Twice stolen and twice sold haha)

(Don't get caught)

(Aww you won't have a phone for awhile)

(Nah)

(Everything will have to be done by mail)

(Mollie I'm getting one before this weekend)

(Maybe even today)

(Woah really?)

(This time is genuine and unlocked)

(Are you gonna report it?)

(Nah
Mollie that's too much hassle
Just think about it
I won't even get anything for it)

(Ok that's what I thought)

(Cause technically it's not mine. It's t mobiles. They can just take it. You can't transfer ownership of something you don't own)

(But you were acting shady)

(That guy never owned it)

(That's what I thought Ryan)

(Mmm)

(You said it weird
So today)

(You're gonna just buy it?)

(Yeah I just ordered it off Amazon)

(It should be here today or tomorrow)

(Woah)

(Then I sell this one, maybe make $50 and move on haha)

(Ooohhh)

(Maybe......)

(Wait
Is that fraud?
Kinda?)

(Youuuuu)

(It's fine)

(Sneaky 
Little)

(Bastard)

(Honestly I bought it with cash)

(So t mobile has absolutely no idea who bought it
Or where it is)

(Woahhhhoho)

(https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K0YEVNacmtw)

(Haha)

(I'd be okay with dancing to this song
Maybe)

(Awww)

(Yup)

(I wanna do that
Did you wake up?
Wake uppp boy)

(Now I am
Frick there's not a lot of time left. I think we're gonna have to bail
I'm sorry)

(I'm taking a nap rn anyway I'm super tired)

(Same)

(Ugh
Mollie I slept in until 2:00 again
Dammit)

(Dammit Ryan)

(What're you up to now?)

(Just about to head on out to Robbins)

(Nonono haha it's fine)

(Oh my god did you go back to bed?
Ryan Jacobs
I guess it's kinda my fault for keeping you up 
Sorry bout that)

(I'm still up)

(Aww what a champ)

(Not really 😂)

(Are you ok btw?)

(For the champ part)

(I don't really remember everything that happened)

(The okay part is yes)

(I'm okay
Really?)

(Well I do)

(I figured we were both lucid haha)

(It's just kinda a blur idk)

(Mmm)

(That's how I see everyday girl)

(I just wanted to be sure I didn't hurt you or anything)

(Nah I'm good)

(Mmm perfect)

(And I have a joystick that I haven't used in 5 years)

(I'll put him in a ww2 fighter plane)

(Mmm)

(Take him back to the good old days

I just probably can't leave my house is all)

(You're supposed to be allowed to go out, as long as you're back by 10:30)

(Yes but papa is gone so it's just me and joe all night)

(Awww)

(Sorry Chico
If you wanna come over here though you are more than welcome)

(Okay maybe...
I'll think about it)

(Alright joe and I are on our way home if you're still thinking about it)

(Okay yeah)

(I'll stop by in like 15 min
I've got a surprise too 😌)

(Oh?)

(I'm here)

(Are you bringing your game?)

(Come on in)

(Heyyy)

(Mmm)

(Haha did you sleep in?)

(Just who I was just dreaming about)

(Well yes but I took a nap 😂)

(Anyways I'm texting you because I'm going to the Newcastle cheese shop and the post office with Kyle and Em at 1:00)

(If you wanna mess around and get good too
Food)

(Awww I can't)

(Teach joe to drive dammit)

(I have to take joe and see grandpa Phil
Dammit I love those sandwiches)

(Fine
I'll just third wheel)

(Sorryyyyyy)

(It's cool)

(I don't want this)

(Ssshhh)

(Lo siento mi amor
But at least you're not in a nursing home with your demented grandpa)

(He's just "touched"
It's okay)

(Mmmm)

(Oh yeah)

(No)

(My road is closed today
So I have to walk everywhere)

(Haha)

(Aww no)

(So no visits to your house?
Good thing I'm the one home alone)

(It's not that bad
I just walk down to flyers to get rides)

(Haha)

(Maybe we can carve our initials into the pavement before it dries)

(I bet all the truckers are just ecstatic to pick up an exotic piece like you)

(Haha yeah, I'm basically fending them off. It's hard when you look this good, all hot and sweaty)

(Wgat?!)

(Dukelana 🤗)

(Mmm
Oh yeah baby
Dammit Ryan no
I've already been thinking about that
Don't do that
But
This pavement 
Where is it?)

(Ok ok)

(What?)

(How long?)

(Also you were thinking about this?)

(No pavement)

(Probably 1:00 to 1:30)

(But I want to know how long until it's dry)

(Haha)

(Oh god)

(I think it's a Moho)

(Ok)

(No go)

(No?)

(You have chauffeur duties)

(No pavement?)

(Well yes I am aware)

(Yeah)

(Can we get to that wet pavement?)

(We can?)

(Yeah I think so)

(Can I get you?)

(Look I'm gonna walk out rn and check it out)

(Ok ok)

(I'm sitting in my living room rn)

(Go look)

(Me too)

(And I can hear the machines)

(Yayyyy)

(Coming down glen virw)

(View
Which is the long one to the left of my house)

(I know)

(So what's your whole schedule today?)

(Grandpa Phil)

(I know, but like timing)

(At some point, groceries
That's it)

(Grandpa at 1)

(Oh okay)

(Can be pushed back or moved up)

(I'm just running things through my head
Cause I'm meeting Kyle and Em at 1:30 now)

(You are?)

(So idk if the pavement thing is gonna work out...)

(When is the pavement wet?)

(Nooooo)

(I'll look rn okay?)

(Ryan)

(I know I know)

(Think how great that would be)

(Plus it's right by my house
That'd be super cool
So why don't you do grandpa phil as early as you can, then you're free)

(I mean)

(Idk)

(I'm pretty much gonna go rn
Hey we bounced
Where are you rn?
Hey
Where can I get tie dye)

(I'm walking to the post office rn)

(Ok. Joe and I are about to leave target)

(Go to the Newcastle post office)

(Where should I get you?
?)

(I'm shipping stuff rn
I'll be done really soon)

(Alrighty)

(Bye)

(Bye bye)

(Hey can we bring Michael too?)

(Also why 1:00 specifically?)

(Oh shoot yeah)

(Like past 8pm-ish right? Makes sense)

(Uhhh that's just what jace said the other day
It doesn't really matter but for me it can't be late)

(Right right)

(So Hannah can't go...)

(Idk if you guys still go forward if everyone can't make it or not
Wait nvm whatever. This is your thing, not mine
Hey Mollie)

(Hey Ryan)

(Oh sorry)

(I just felt like texting you)

(Really?)

(How's it going?)

(Haha
That's a first)

(I'm guessing you're busy tonight)

(I'm with the fam)

(What for tomorrow morning?)

(And now apparently I'm dropping Audrey off at 7:15 😢
I wish we could go to the park)

(And think of things o say to impress the other person so they want to go on another date)

(Haha why)

(And make excuses up to our parents about where we are)

(Oh
Yes)

(Haha)

(What haha 🙄)

(Idk for some reason I got a hit of nostalgia)

(Thinking of things to say to impress the other person)

(Cuz you made me nervous 😂)

(Still is 😂)

(A lot was riding on you)

(Hahaha
Okay don't be mad)

(Your drunk)

(Yeah fix your grammar)

(You're)

(Not really
Idk
I normally don't start this early
I'm sorry)

(I figured)

(And then my mom walked in and well crap)

(Or else you never would have texted)

(Idk
It's not like they care anyways, just the first time they saw)

(On you drunk?)

(Eh whatever)

(Oh crap
What do you have?)

(I just wanted to text you)

(Ryan)

(Hey)

(Fuck)

(It's ok)

(I don't know what to say anymore)

(I'm five)

(I can't)

(Fine
I'm sorry Mollie
I'm sorry)

(You're not)

(Ugh nvm)

(But I don't think I can fix it
And I don't know how to make you fix it)

(I wish I didn't love you so much)

(Mollie stop it)

(Stop please)

(Stop what?)

(Saying that)

(What?)

(Saying what?)

(Yes)

(That I care what happens to you?)

(That)

(I gave you everything dammit. Who I choose to be with is a reflection of myself Ryan)

(Me too)

(You are a big part of my person now
Don't you understand that?)

(I changed for you)

(Dammit)

(And because of you)

(I like you so much)

(Do you?)

(More than anyone else)

(Out of all the people in the world
You're the only person I really trust
The only person
That's probably why I text you
But I swear it's not because of that
You are not a crutch
Don't get that message
You're better than me okay?)

(Stop saying that)

(Mollie I tell you)

(Why?
Why am I better?)

(And I keep telling you
Maybe you don't listen, like I don't
Hey you know what?
People texted me yesterday, reaching out to help
And I fucking shoved them away)

(I know)

(Wait)

(What did you say?)

(You knew?)

(I was there when you told them)

(Fuck)

(I saw it pop up
But I didn't read because I felt guilty
I was there when you told them though
And they were sober)

(I'm sorry
Mollie I'm sorry
There's so many things I want to say rn
Shoot)

(Just tell me)

(I need to stop texting you)

(Okay I'm done
Maybe later)

(At least let me be there)

(Look)

(No wait
Ryan don't leave me like this)

(I'm sorry)

(Ryan just let me feel a little better)

(I shouldn't have texted you)

(I just get impulsive like this
And I texted you)

(Give me something concrete please)

(That was stupid)

(Talk to me)

(Hi)

(No)

(Okay just give me a five min break)

(I was so excited
To just hear you say hey)

(Me too)

(And not be asking for anything)

(I wish you would text me out of the blue more)

(And just to talk)

(For talkings sake)

(Or Snapchat)

(Anything)

(You never like it)

(Being first sucks it)

(You send me away)

(No that's not true)

(When have I ever done that?)

(Every time)

(I'm sorry that's what I do)

(You ask if I'm supposed to be working
Or isn't it past my bedtime)

(And I know why)

(Why then?)

(Awwwww)

(It hurts so fucking much)

(I'm sorry)

(I know I shouldn't let it get to me but it does and I can never stop thinking about it)

(So sorry)

(Stop it mollie
I don't want to hurt
Stop
Awww)

(I don't either)

(Why didn't you tell me?)

(So tell me why)

(I wanna hug you)

(I get sad)

(And it makes me feel weak and dumb)

(Right now)

(No
Mollie jo)

(I don't wanna feel stupid to you)

(No)

(I want to be your equal)

(You're not stupid)

(You are my equal
Haha
I believe it honestly
I don't believe that the man (or the women (or the other man)) should be the dominant partner
They should be equal
And complete each other)

(I do too)

(Fuck dominance)

(I just want to feel like that)

(That's all)

(Equal)

(If I didn't truly believe that you were my equal
Then I would have Never asked you out
Never
That's the only reason I ask people out, because I sense some inking that they're my equal, finally
And you were the strongest in that regard and you lasted
It wasn't awkward
You know why?
Because I didn't doubt it
Being awkward with other dates, is a way of your body telling you, I'm not sure
You don't get super nervous when you're with the right person
Okay?)

(Haha)

(Equals)

(Okay Ryan
Thank you)

(With some parts being better
And some parts being weaker
But we both add up to the same number
Whatever it may be)

(Thank you Ryan)

(Nope)

(Hey
The other morning you said there were some things you wanted to talk about 
What was it)

(What)

(Mollie it's okay it's nothing)

(What?
Do I not remember soemthing?)

(I was probably just seeking attention
Trying to make up a mystery because you emptied me already)

(Is it bad that I like mysteries like that?)

(Nah)

(Does it screw people up?
That I just keep digging and digging)

(And trying to know everything about them?)

(That's why we read)

(And love stories)

(And wanting there to be more?)

(And life)

(Hahaha)

(Haha)

(You're fine)

(It's weird)

(You can always find meaning in nothing)

(I guess I just always want something special 
To have to myself)

(Ryan I got upset when you were talking to the other kids that night)

(Really?)

(About all your bad stuff)

(It was weird)

(Yeah you did put your hand over my mouth)

(I felt so ashamed I left)

(I don't think I said that much)

(You did)

(Oh crap you remember?)

(I remember that)

(I did?)

(I felt bad)

(I'm sorry)

(Like I betrayed you
Kinda like cheating
I'm sorry
You were my rock
My only rock
Ever
And then I found some pebbles, and for some reason, I went to them
It wasn't the same)

(I don't like that part of myself)

(What part?)

(It gets ugly
I'm sorry
Thanks Ryan)

(The jealousy?)

(Woah)

(Maybe)

(I've never put a name to it
Do you think that I'm always jealous because I'm not used to having control in my life?
And that's what gives me so much anxiety all the time?)

(That does make a bit of sense)

(Woah)

(And I'm the opposite I guess. Too much autonomy and power, and the freedom gets to my head and drives me insane)

(I feel very weird
I wish I was drunk)

(And you're not used to freedom, so when you get it the anxiety gets to you
And it feels wrong and twisted and incorrect
See like I said
Equals haha)

(And I can't self motivate)

(Awwww)

(Cuz it always feels like someone's just gonna come and take whatever I do away
It can never be on my terms
Jesus)

(We're a happy medium then?)

(I wish you were here)

(I give sage advice when I'm a little more than buzzed I guess
Yay)

(Mmm)

(That makes me smile haha)

(And you text pretty)

(Good)

(Nah that's fine)

(I'm glad that still happens when we talk 😂
I wish it wasn't always drunk though)

(See wtf)

(Don't say that)

(My mom just walked in again)

(With more alcohol)

(You're trying to make it seem ok)

(In her cup)

(What)

(And asked if I need her to buy me some)

(What?
She brought it to you?)

(No not quite that forward)

(Tell me)

(It was hers)

(Exactly what happened)

(Hahaha maybe)

(She's drinking?
Maybe she wants to be drunk with you?)

(I don't think so)

(How do Chinese people feel about this stuff?)

(I already know why)

(Nah idk)

(Maybe you made her sad)

(There's rice stuff up in Portland all the time)

(Well I know she drinks when she feels like it's socially acceptable
So aka when I do it
Cause my dad doesn't like it
Probably makes her feel bad
Then I come along, like a fresh new justification)

(So she drinks as long as she's not alone)

(Yeah I guess)

(Well your house is changing)

(I guess)

(At parties she does)

(But my dad doesn't really
Brb one sec
Or one min idk
Back
I've narrowed it down to three reasons)

(For?)

(And I know all of them are right)

(They all contribute
Her offering to supply all the time)

(She wants it for herself?)

(Hahaha reason 1)

(She wants you to like her)

(Reason 2)

(So your dad doesn't notice it missing)

(Uh no)

(?)

(Mm)

(I don't think she cares that much about that)

(Lemme try again)

(But my dad does judge her)

(You dad is stuck up)

(Like all the time with these snarky condescending commits)

(Don't worry about it)

(Yeah)

(Like he does to me)

(Like mom)

(Hahaha)

(That's how it goes)

(Again)

(Alright reason 3)

(Equal but opposite)

(Let's see)

(Mollie this one is innocent)

(She wants to have soemthing that your dad doesn't?
Some way to be close to you?)

(That was #2 again
She cares for my safety)

(True true)

(Doesn't want to let me out. Better she knows where it comes from and how I get it)

(Awww
Right right
If you get it from her
You don't have to get it else where)

(Yup)

(I like your mom)

(Eh yeah)

(You don't?)

(But she's also super jealous rn)

(I do)

(What's up?)

(I love both my parents)

(Hahaha)

(I know you do)

(She thinks some other parent is supplying)

(And she wants to be that parent
To be liked
And close
Mollie why couldn't you be here right now?
I wish we were done with college
And living together)

(Awww)

(Not having to fear someone barging in)

(Yeah I like her)

(Just chilling in the living room)

(I get that)

(We're both jealous 😂)

(Or the bedroom)

(Or wherever)

(Playing two player games)

(Because it doesn't matter anymore)

(Reading books)

(Yes)

(Yes
No judgement)

(Being in pajamas or underwear or nothing)

(No parents)

(Yes
Exactly
Free
Working)

(Mmmm)

(Having money to spend)

(In my house you could do that 😂)

(Not a lot)

(Ugh that sounds great)

(But not having to consciously worrying about it)

(But a reasonable amount)

(A nice, blue collar existence)

(Whether or not to pull out)

(Regarding stocks or each other
Hahaha 🙄)

(Hahaha 😂)

(Mmm)

(I'm finding my damn socks
I hid them last time
Too well)

(Haha don't worry)

(😄)

(I'll supply 😏)

(You make smile sometimes
So sweet and kind
That's why I love you)

(So smoking hot)

(Okay)

(Maybe)

(And funny and brilliant)

(Of course)

(An good at planking)

(Those ones undeniably)

(Awwww)

(Indutibaly)

(Ryan
Now I'm smiling too)

(Ughhhh)

(Haha yes)

(Yeah Haha
I want more of those
And to watch them with you)

(I want to finish Submarine too)

(Oh yeah!)

(Can we have another drunk alone together night? I like those every once in while)

(Me too)

(It makes me feel close to you)

(Me too)

(I can talk finally)

(But it's okay)

(I was actually thinking about that today)

(I'll just get a little more than buzzed)

(So I can talk but with correct spelling
Like rn
Really?)

(Yeahhh)

(Haha tell me more)

(Can we talk on the phone?
That's easier)

(Uhhh)

(Aww)

(I need to shower rn
And moms about to be home)

(Don't leave me)

(So maybe you take some more shots)

(Okay)

(Anddddd)

(Hahaha)

(I kinda want to)

(We phone call in a little bit?)

(Ugh)

(Mollie)

(I'm sorry)

(But I should save it for in person)

(I want to)

(I shouldn't have said that)

(But ugh)

(Nonono
It's okay
You're not encouraging)

(I just kinda figured you would)

(It's my choice)

(I only sipped on that captain Morgan's
I waited for a week or so
And didn't touch it
So we could have it)

(Are you drinking the Malibu?)

(I saved that beer)

(Awww)

(Too)

(You're so seeet)

(No)

(Sweet
That damn willpower)

(Not the Malibu
That's for us
Okay?
We need a night together again
But I wanna start at like 8pm and go to bed earlier)

(Yeahhhh)

(3am talks with you suck)

(Really? 😂)

(Yeah cause you only half listen)

(Awww I'm sorry)

(And mumble "mmm hmm yeah")

(But I also kinda like that
Being able to talk)

(It's usually hard to think to be fair 😂)

(And doubting if they actually hear and/or remember)

(Yeah)

(Mmm okay)

(So soon?
Maybe?)

(You usually want me not too)

(Ok)

(To
Yes
I'm getting in the shower now
Like 20 min?)

(Maybe)

(Please mollie)

(Please what?)

(Oh)

(What is it?)

(I was talking about having a kit all 
Might soon
Night soon
Jesus Christ
Mollie,?)

(I'm here I want that too)

(Haha no)

(K 10 min
Are you asleep?)

(How are you?)

(Eh sobering)

(So pretty meh
I'm just coding rn
Sorry to disappoint haha
Did I scare you off right now?)

(One sec)

(Mollie I'm fine)

(Ok I'm back
It's ok it's probably for the best that you didn't mess yourself up
Starting that early was a little concerning)

(Ok Ryan)

(Sorry)

(Do what you want with yourself 
But just stop saying that to me
It drives me insane)

(I don't think I'm hurting myself honestly
It's okay
Maybe we should sleep idk
I wish you were here)

(It's not. It's your brain rationalizing your behavior trust me I know)

(Oh and also)

(I don't know
This is all on you I guess)

(Sorry for telling you off whenever you texted me
Like saying it was your bedtime or that you were supposed to be working
Whenever you text me out of the blue, I'm completely ecstatic for the hour after
I really am)

(That makes me feel so much better Ryan)

(Awww)

(That was bothering me so damn much I just hated to say it)

(I wish you had said something
That's such a little thing
An easy fix
I do it because I need to really really know that you want me
So it's me double checking that you want me more than work, more than sleep)

(I didn't think of that)

(I'll try to be better and do without it. But I do it to everyone really)

(And I know it is but I didn't want it to be a fix)

(It's unconscious most of the time)

(I know)

(That's why I hate it)

(I'm sorry)

(Can we talk for maybe 20 min?
I don't have anything big to say. But your voice is comforting idk)

(Aww)

(Okay I'm gonna wander around outside)

(Yeah
But give me like 5 min so mom goes upstairs)

(Okay)

(That's the freakin best)

(I know, I love it at night too)

(Ok so)

(Give me one minute)

(Still want a call
A quick one? I need to sleep)

(Ok)

(Ok)

(Hey are you up?)

(Hey girl)

(Ryan
Why must you sleep so
I want it)

(I'm sleepy)

(Oh my god)

(But I'm up)

(I didn't expect a response)

(Nah)

(Did I wake you up?)

(Well maybe
I got a boatload of texts and you were one of them)

(And somewhere your heart just knew it was important and you had to wake up)

(Of course)

(Or maybe it was a different body part)

(Aww)

(Haha
Sorry you don't actually have to meet me
I know you're sleepy)

(What're you up to rn?)

(Leaving moms office to hit up the bank and then idk)

(Oh I see)

(Nothing until Susan at 12)

(Hey wanna come over for a bit?
That's probably good, if you have Susan, you'll have to leave by 11:00-11:30)

(Really?)

(Haha cashing that paycheck aren't you?)

(Yeah that's cool)

(Mmmhmmm)

(I don't really see how you didn't make more, working 12 hour days)

(All 700 son
Haha

Do you think later we could…uh you know)

(Have an intimate meeting)

(Yeah I'd be down)

(Yeahhh)

(Down to...)

(Actually I did but she doesn't have the hours)

(Was that not subtle)

(Haha)

(HELL YEAH MOTHERFUCKER)

(Oh damn that sucks)

(You always are mdear)

(But 700 is nice
That's like one quality abortion)

(Yeahhhhhh)

(Yayyy)

(Ugh

I need to go in there)

(Once I cash this thing)

(Yes yes yes)

(Beginning of next week)

(Ok damn then I have to go)

(Yes it is)

(Haha what happened?)

(I hate the bank)

(Moms accounts are so messed up)

(Yeah I know)

(Wait maybe not)

(And she wrote my checks on her old checks 🙄 go figure)

(Ohhh haha)

(So they didn't go through?)

(Nope)

(Nice)

(All that 
For nada
On my end
La vida
Can I still come over?)

(Yeah)

(Ok good)

(But hurry)

(Here I come)

(The sooner you get here the more time we have)

(For some love)

(Yeepppp)

(On it)

(Can I come in?)

(Yeah)

(I'll be down in a sec)

(Now you really won't)

(Ugh)

(Cuz I'm in sf)

(But SF would've definitely been an exception)

(Sorry babe)

(For sure)

(That's what I thought)

Though I'm not sure that really applies to the situation rn
Ooh did you leave?
Off to fantasize a little more vividly?)

(Mmm hahaha)

(I thought it tasted bitter)

(Did you?
You sound so salty baby)

(Mmm)

(Mmm)

(The bitterness of self-gratification 
Looks like I know how to temper an iron will)

(Nope
I didn't give in
No way)

(No?)

(Not Ryan Jacobs)

(Really?)

('Course not)

(Just a little heavy petting through the pants)

(Haha maybe)

(?)

(Haha that's what I thought)

(Please)

(Mmm
Soon
I'm gonna do thsi
This
And you won't be able to help yourself)

(No not that
Nope)

(Oh yeah)

(Fuck)

(If you want
I'll be in the room
And you can just drag my hand over)

(Then it won't be so bad)

(Stop it)

(Wouldn't that be fun?)

(Mollie)

(I swear if you keep this up
I'm going to throw my phone at the wall
And drive straight to Nevada
20 grand can buy me a lot of hookers)

(Hookers with small boobs and tall white socks?)

(Awww frick)

(Hookers that have never done anything with anyone else?
That know what you like?)

(Mollie I love everything about you
I don't think I could do it with anyone else but you
Mmmm those small boobs, they really do it for me
So cute)

(Mmmm)

(Hahahaha)

(You were such a perfect find
Such a beautiful, smart perfect fund
Find)

(Freudian slip 😂
Haha I'm just kidding)

(NNOOOO)

(But it was too perfect)

(hahaha)

(Right right)

(Hey now
I come from a family of female bread winners
You think I expect to be taken care of?)

(You think I would be going to college? 😂)

(What happens when the bread gets stale though?)

(That happens because there's too much bread)

(Awww)

(And that's usually when we start fighting)

(You just need someone to share the bread with)

(No)

(Awww)

(So that it never gets stale)

(I've never seen this metaphor taken that far)

(And it's the right amount)

(But I'm okay with it)

(And everyone's happy)

(Yes of course)

(And full of bread)

(Mmmm)

(And ready to be harvested)

(They call me the "bread harvester"
Hahaha
Not a gold digger
A bread harvester
Or a grain machine
Idk
I think this is getting stretched real thin)

(Eh)

(Yes)

(Not close enough
You stop now)

(Yessir 
Whatever you want miss mollie)

(Your people seem like they're better with rice)

(Mollie I've made a mistake)

(I hope it was a coding mistake)

(Haha)

(You meanie)

(Mollie sometime we should sit down
And we'll make something cool
I'm serious we could make something rad
I did that VR stuff in a day)

(That would be great)

(Oh)

(What was the mistake?)

(I watched episode 10 of season 2
Instead of episode 1
Whoops
Now I spoiled a bunch)

(Do not talk to me)

(It was a very sad ending)

(I'm so mad 
No more talking tonight
Why would you do that)

(Why)

(Hey mollie?)

(Why would you)

(What country is mom from?
🙄)

(From China)

(Oh good)

(Grew up in Taiwan)

(Also born there too)

(Yes)

(For a sec, I thought that you thought Thailand)

(And I was slightly miffed)

(Is that why it autocorrected to?)

(Oh haha)

(Hat
What
Damn)

(I guess so)

(I pay great attention to your family history I assure you)

(Wait you're eating tawainese?)

(Taiwan doesn't seem so bad
Their food is really good)

(Yes)

(Aww)

(I think so)

(Not a lot of English)

(Damn)

(Or forks)

(Like that whole side of the family grew up selling those noodles in a shop
With a dirt floor)

(Awwww)

(And now you're eating them)

(I feel so close to your family 😂)

(￼)

(Tell your mom Taiwanese is really really good)

(Will do
Maybe
Bring my mom next time
And me
Definitely me)

(Haha)

(Yeah haha)

(Mom might actually take you up on that 😂
Will do)

(Alright
Oh damn that might be a while
Next weekend is when I leave)

(Awww)

(The 13th is Sunday)

(That makes me so sad)

(Jesus what's gonna happen to me when I leave)

(Mollie wait I want to tell you something 😂)

(I'm here the 25-26)

(Really?!)

(What nowwee)

(Awesome)

(Wait we can go to sf for my birthday)

(Yes)

(Okay so what if I'm a little late...)

(Yes
I did that for sweet sixteen
I know what we can do)

(Make a scavenger hunt)

(Make one?)

(Yes)

(Hmmm okay)

(We have one
It's all clever
And goes to weird places)

(Ok ok)

(Oh yeah)

(Tell me?)

(So you know that elephant shirt)

(Yes)

(I picked it up like ten minutes ago, I just smelled it)

(?
My favorite)

(Ugh
It smelled like you
So much)

(Awww)

(It was like you were there)

(Ha
Makes sense)

(No joke)

(Awwwww)

(Like I can't even explain how close it was)

(Ryan)

(It smelled exactly like you. Like I was hugging you)

(Awwww)

(Yeah and then I just got this overwhelming sense of longing)

(Ryan
My heart right now
I'm so full of noodles and love
Put it on a pillow and hug it)

(Idk maybe
I don't want to break down
But it was extremely comforting)

(Aw Ryan)

(Fine maybe)

(I wish I had a shirt
I want a shirt Ryan)

(No)

(Idk what makes you smell the way you do)

(Not maybe)

(I want a shirt)

(Cause I don't think it's sweat really)

(I'm getting one)

(I will take it)

(But it was 100% "you")

(Nah
It's like soap and detergent
And skin and stuff)

(Awww)

(Awww)

(Ryan that's so sweet
Ryan
I'm gonna need one for college 
Not to freak you out)

(That's alright)

(I'm just saying)

(I'm wondering how long the smell will last)

(It's gonna mess me up 
A lot)

(I think it's good until you wash it honestly haha
I'll give you the elephant shirt again
Oh
And we'll go to target again
And make out in my car
To wolfmother)

(Yeahhhhahaha)

(Oh damn gtg)

(And maybe I can go down)

(Well this time)

(Maybe)

(Mmm)

(Text me on the drive home)

(Aw
Ok 
By love)

(See ya
Tomorrow for sure
Hey)

(Hi)

(Salutations)

(Uh
So my whole family's gonna be gone until noon-ish tomorrow
It's not like we can do anything right though?)

(Uh)

(Yeah haha)

(If everyone's gone…then no ones in the shower right?)

(We could do that)

(We could do anything in the shower)

(Haha)

(Feasibly)

(Easy cleanup ostensibly
Maybe one tequila shot and still be safe
That stuff is completely worn off in 4 hours
Ugh idk
There's a lot we can do in 4 hours in a house alone)

(Damn)

(Okay I'll keep you posted)

(That sounds so fun)

(But sounds like they're leaving at 8:30)

(Mmm yeah)

(Yesss)

(So I can come over all nasty 
Then shower)

(I'll have crazy bedhead too)

(Mmm and glasses)

(For a bit yeah)

(For a bit
Yeah)

(Haha)

(Ryan I kinda want to do it a little with glasses sometime)

(Haha sure with the glasses thing)

(And kinda hard)

(Can you explain the hard thing? 😂
Like rough?)

(…yes?)

(Okay sure)

(Idk if it's just the time of the month or what)

(Ahaha)

(Whatever you want)

(That just sounds really great)

(Just come over tomorrow)

(So it's okay if we do stuff right?
It's just messy that's all...)

(I think so)

(It's not like it's gonna hurt you right?)

(I hope not)

(It's just super super wet)

(Wet with blood?...)

(Nah)

(If anything it'll be less painful)

(Hahahhaa)

(Uhhh
Yes)

(Jesus Christ)

(If it's too freaky)

(Mollie I'm down haha)

(We don't have to
I understand)

(Haha)

(I'm an adventurous soul)

(Mmm)

(Mmmm)

(Just another thing I love)

(Okay
So here's the plan
They're aiming to leave at 8:30
But really, it's probably gonna be 9:00
If I end up sleeping in, show up at 9:30
Otherwise if I'm up, I will text you the second they leave
I'll try to be up, so we can make the most of it)

(Yayyyy)

(Yes good girl)

(Ok 
Then I'm gonna sleep in the car
Rn)

(So I'm not too messed up)

(And if I happen to be asleep, don't be afraid to start stuff 🙄)

(Mmm
I am)

(Haha)

(Oh Ryan)

(Sleep well mollie)

(I might)

(You too)

(Okay okay)

(And soon please)

(By midnight I promise)

(AT LEAST)

(Ugh I know)

(It's bad

(Moving up)

(Yeah you too)

(Ugh)

(I mowed everything 
My legs

(We have some special Chinese stuff for big bites

Eh you're probably not dead, just grounded or something. Goodnight my favorite person)

(Got it)

(?)

(Ok)

(Oh shoot)

(I'm not that sure what she was looking at but I know she at least opened your texts)

(Well that seems like an invasion of privacy)

(Right)

(I'm glad we having nothing to hide)

(Which pisses me off)

(*have)

(Not anymore I guess)

(Yeahhh)

(Okay I'm so fed up with this
Like in a month
A *month*
You will be overseas)

(I know)

(And you'll be able to do whatever you freaking want)

(That's what's driving me crazy)

(Like whatever)

(I just want to be my own person)

(Stop caring Jesus Christ)

(So freakin bad)

(You could whore yourself out and drink every night)

(And do lines of cocaine for breakfast
Maybe that's scaring her
Idk
But this overbearing attitude is going to make your last month at home a living hell
And it's going to scare you away so you never come back. I hope she realizes that
My parents scared me off and now they're back pedaling trying to get me back)

(I know that's what makes me crazy)

(Did your mom come home yet?)

(I just want to be able to live in my own home and be totally free for once
It's not like I'm on drugs or killing people 
I just want to make my last month a good one 
I just want more happy memories here)

(Nah)

(Oh god)

(Just cookin and waitin)

(I'm nervous for you)

(Jesus)

(Sorry)

(I wasn't even that nervous until you
Oh god)

(🙄
So are we still allowed to see each other? Or what?
Haha I've got this feeling like she's gonna put a brick wall between us
But that seems phony)

(She can't exactly stop us)

(Uhhhhh)

(I almost invited you over actually 😂)

(Yes she can 😂)

(Awww)

(How tho)

(Hmmm)

(I guess not really)

(Yeah)

(But she could make life absolutely miserable)

("Could")

(Like just take your phone)

(Ummmm)

(And your car)

(And I'm not allowed at your house
Etc
If it came to that, it'd be a lot of me driving over to you and stealing you)

(Yeahhhh)

(And then phone calls to my parents)

(But I need car)

(Yeah let's not get to that point)

(Because I work for them
Oh Jesus)

(Oh my god Ryan)

(An arranged marriage with that Swiss guy...)

(I'm so stressed now)

(Honestly you could do a lot worse)

(Hahaha)

(That doesn't sound like a Swiss name)

(Ahhhh Patrick)

(Unless he just thought I was cute and lied about everything to strike up a conversation and follow me around all day)

(Plausible, I can see myself doing that)

(But then again, the apple discount...)

(Soooooo just a socially awkward engineer at apple then)

(Awwww)

(Socially awkward engineers are the best)

(That'll be youuuu)

(Idk what you're talking about)

(I'm soooo socially adept
And un-engineer like)

(Right right)

(Oh wait sorry)

(You talk allllll the time
Visibly outgoing 
Verrryyyyyy physical and exuberant)

(Did you say something?
I couldn't hear you over all of the voices at this massive party I'm hosting)

(^^^when you're so lonely you start hearing voices 🙄)

(Eh whatever)

(It boosts creativity
Hey did you ever get around to watching the 3rd episode?)

(Pickle rick is the only thing that got me through this day)

(Awww)

(Papa just called and gave me sex talk)

(Uh oh)

(Without telling mom he was but now he's talking to her and idk what's going on)

(But I think he wants to talk to you. Not to go after you just to figure out where your heads at)

(Shit)

(He said it's ok and he loves me no matter what and it's my life)

(Can we talk on the phone?)

(He still likes you
It just caught him off guard initially 
But he's not that surprised)

(He did a lot worse)

(Okay)

(Uh yeah but later)

(I still haven't eaten and I think moms gonna come talk to me)

(Okayyy)

(Well it seems like the world is finally crashing down
Took long enough)

(Part of it is almost nice)

(Yeah I get what you mean)

(In a weird way)

(And if we make it past all of this, props to us

Also on the plus side, my stocks are going up again
So I've got that going for me right now)

I had to force it)

(I need to get a Greek phone number)

(You have to pay roaming fees)

(You have to anyways)

(But they're super cheap for North America - Mexico and Canada)

(Hmmm)

(For Europe it's more)

(Interesting)

(But for me, it's a good deal)

(Plus unlimited talk and text finally
And 2gb of data
For under $15 a month)

(Nice)

(Yeah I know)

(Wow really?!)

(Smart boy
Alright)

(It's creepy I don't like it)

(I know I know)

(Good)

(Mollie that's why I incognito everything
Not cause I have something to hide)

(I don't know how)

(Sleepy

(That was a great Susan meeting)

(Nice
Okay

In one word)

(Validating)

(Hmm I wouldn't have guessed that one)

(We had the whole talk)

(Awww)

(She told me about her first time and how great it was 😂)

(That's so sweet)

(It really was)

(She sounds so nice right now)

(And how no matter what my parents said she was my therapist and no one would ever et anything out of her
It was just so nice to hear that from an adult I think
It just made me feel more human I guess)

(She's so nice)

(Hahah what)

(She looks like a little grandma
And she has a little old truck
😂 that she took the seats out of to put massive subwoofers in because she likes the bass
She's fun)

(That's so cute and funny)

(That's her)

(4:00 is the goal)

(Also I found out how to call without caller id
It's super cool
Just dial *67 before the rest of the number)

(Hey)

(Wait you can't just throw that onto me)

(Can you find me everything you know about Matt berni?
We had art history with him?)

(Idk I met him in 6th grade I think
Pretty funny kid
Called me Brian all the time cause he said it was my alter ego
I taught him how to read binary and we sent each other messages on pieces of scrap paper)

(Oh Ryan)

(What why)

(Did he do something bad?
I don't think high school was good to him)

(Ryan…)

(Shit)

(He's dead)

(That really hurts)

(Ryan I'm so sorry)

(It's okay)

(No one knows what happened 
I thought you might be able to find out I don't know
I'm so sorry Ryan)

(I'm just going to lay down for a bit
Sorry if I don't text back right away)

(Should I come over?)

(Nah)

(I deal with these things better alone
It's okay)

(I'm sorry Ryan)

(Oh god)

(And he was my partner in Yosemite)

(I'm coming over)

(We made videos together)

(No you're not
I'm busy
I'm fine)

(Ryan)

(Hey when did this happen?)

(Just let me come hug you a little and I'll go)

(Yesterday)

(So nobody knows details in the sense that friends don't know?)

(No one knows details
I thought it might be able to find out)

(Or are we talking about family too? And police?)

(Friends don't know)

(Oh right)

(I don't think)

(Okay)

(Mrs smith told a kid)

(Yeah I would say so)

(That's all
She's pretty messed up about it)

(Matt was a funny guy
Okay I'm going on a run
So don't text me for a bit
I'm all good though)

(Ok Ryan)

(My sister's coming home in about an hour, so you can over then to reset the phone)

(How long?)

(Let's say 6:30 at the earliest)

(Ok Ryan)

(Ugh)

(Okay
A thought just ran through my head and I probably shouldn't
But I can get all of his accounts)

(I know)

(Instagram DMs maybe and personal emails and probably imessage)

(Would that tell us anything though?)

(iMessage would cover a lot of stuff)

(Oh go that's right)

(Hahaha maybe)

(God
Can you do it without being caught though?
Cuz it's a felony)

(Against who?)

(Uhhh)

(Let's do 7:00)

(His family?
I don't know
Ryan be smart
Take care of yourself until I get there
Then I will)

(Alright)

(Oh frick)

(Can I come in?)

(Um)

(What)

(Yeah come up stairs)

(I'm outside the door)

(Ok)

(Hey uh mollie)

(You might be receiving a shipment of boba tea next Wednesday
Just fyi)

(What)

(Yeah I ordered it)

(What)

(And since I was gonna be gone, I put your address so we could make it when I got back
But then I had second thoughts and tried to cancel it, which didn't work, so now you're getting boba
Enjoy 🙄)

(Audrey will be thrilled)

(How's it hanging?)

(Hey have you seen what's eating Gilbert grape?
Aww I wanna hug you right now dammit)

(That's such a quality movie omg let's watch that)

(What)

(Ok
That was not at all what I expected
I was crying like a baby
I feel terrible right now)

(Wait hang on
Crying from what?
The talk?)

(Yeah)

(Oh dang I'm sorry)

(Do you want to talk?)

(No)

(Aww mollie)

(Mollie please tell me what's going on
You're stressing me out
And I feel bad
I wanna hug you and hold onto you and let you know that everything's gonna be alright
Please
Aww mollie
Don't be this way please)

(Can't take much of your own medicine can you?)

(That's my problem)

(Just let me think for a little bit)

(I'm sorry
Okay)

(I just)

(Frick you tease)

(You know when you know your shortcomings? All your flaws and deep dark fears and imperfections and you're just so ashamed because they're everything you hate in the world but there seems like there's nothing you can seem to do about it so you just try and mask it with different flaws that for some reason don't seem as bad to you and you live behind those and you think that the only ugly parts of you that people see are the ones that you have perfectly manicured and prepared for them but it turns out that they saw past the charade and they just rip out this unholy chunk of your soul by digging into all of your worst traits and just forcing you to look at them because for awhile you even got to convincing yourself that the bad stuff that you were trying to pass off was the real you and you almost forgot what the ugly really was and then it hits you full force and you just feel make and humiliated and so ashamed of yourself)

(Okay let me read that)

(Oh my god
It's my birthday)

(HAPPY BIRTHDAY
You're about to get some happy birthdays)

(Oh my god)

(Yes)

(I get that Mollie
It's okay
I hide behind problems I make up too)

(I know)

(Aww mollie)

(It just hurts so goddamn much when you get pulled out from behind them
I just wasn't ready)

(What did they do?)

(Ryan)

(Aww mollie)

(I honestly don't even know
They don't even really care about the sex at all
It was just so much about why don't you tell us where you are and what do you do all the time and what are you good for and stuff and why do you do what you do
I don't even know
And who do you think you are and who do you want to be
God idk
Look
Just be with your boys Ryan it's ok
I'm ok)

(Dammit I want to come over and hug the shit outta you
Figuratively
Or they angry about you not getting a job?)

(Not really)

(Dammit I'm sorry)

(It's just more. Uhhh idk, like "you've always been so driven and this and that but lately you've been staying out late making bad choices"
*staying out late is the bad choice 
"Don't you know how much it hurts your parents when we don't know where you are and when you don't come home until midnight."
I don't even know
"I don't see a lot of motivation in you" "should we be paying for school, can you make something out of yourself" 
God I don't know Ryan)

(We'll figure something out
I'm going swimming
But tomorrow
Wait no today, is your today
Okay
Please
I'll make you happy tomorrow
We'll have fun)

(Ryan it's fine don't worry go swimming have fun)

(I love you too)

(Sometimes this stuff needs to happen is all
I love you)

(Nighty night miss mollie
I love you so much
Goodnight ❤️)

(Nighty night)

(Oh god I love you so much)

(I hope to god you live a good life
And I treasure every moment that you choose to let me in
Promise me that we'll try a little bit in college. I don't want to lose you on September 18th
Or when September ends 🙄)

(Dammit Ryan)

(HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOLLIR)

(Ayyyyyy finally legal)

(How does it feel?)

(Well. I kicked it off by rescuing my senior dog from the neighbors pond at 3 am)

(Jesus haha)

(Pretty damn good)

(He likes to sit in there to soak his joints haha)

(Sounds like an old person)

(Hey

(He is an old person)

(Haha okay)

(Woahhhh that looks super good

But if you want to help me bathe Sam you are more than welcome)

(I'll be free by 3:00 ish
How are your parents?
I feel like they kinda of disapprove of me)

(No I don't think they really do)

(Well shit)

(Papa at least likes you I know)

(They were just really mad at me)

(So is it going to be awkward if I come over at some point?)

(Which I already knew
Idk)

(Gosh I wanna see you
Ugh mollie what's gotten into you?
Is everything okay?)

(Haha sorry I've got other things)

(Ughhh)

(Gosh I don't think it will be bad
Idk but you better come over
Cuz we don't see each other for a while)

(Yeah I know 
I'll send you a postcard or something)

(You better)

(What haha)

(I've missed that sweet syntax)

(Hey did you ever get that europe postcard
Or that yellow one?)

(No sirreeeee)

(Well idk)

(You wrote me a stand-in I believe)

(Scott's showed up 45 days late
I guess yours is a goner)

(Awwww)

(Psssh)

(I guess not everything works out for us
Probably your crappy cursive)

(Mmmmmm hahah)

(Well mollie I need to get back to work, so I can leave tomorrow)

(But
Mollie, I want you to know that I love you. And anything that makes you happy, makes me happy. So if you want anything, just let me know, because today is your day
Happy birthday to my favorite person 🎉😘❤️)

(Awww Ryan)

(Holy crap)

(Get your work done so I can see you
That will make me happy)

(Well there's no one at my house rn

(We could kill an hour...)

(Ighhh

(Hmmm let me see)

(What's the deal?)

(I cannot leave the house today)

(Jesus Christ okay)

(Because of me or what?
Or just because it's your birthday...
Idk I feel like a terrible person now)

(I think it's just because Noah and Bree are coming over for dinner and Mom got all hot and bothered over it thinking it's like a party thing so now I have to be here to do yardwork and clean the house and stuff idk)

(Ugh well this sucks)

(I just wanted some close friends to come over for BBQ idk why she gets so worked up)

(I literally leave tomorrow and you're not gonna see me for maybe 10 days
It's okay I'll see you tonight for sure)

(Oh god don't start that Ryan I'll cry or something)

(Yeah)

(I know I'm really bummed
Can you just try to come over here sometime?
I really want to see you)

(After 3:00
I'm careless until 3:00
Car-less
You can't just come over for one measly hour? Jesus Christ they really have you on a leash
... we can test out the life 360 hack haha)

(Well now I can't drive without a kid with me so you need a younger sibling hack now)

(Wait what)

(Ugh)

(I can't leave the house)

(Wtf)

(If I do
I need to bring a sibling)

(What the fuck
I swear if I was you, I'd just get up and drive far, far away
Don't do that though)

(Obviously)

(Yeah you're 18)

(If you were me you'd probably already be off on your own
Papa feels bad about it)

(Jesus Christ
You could just ditch them if you wanted to
Haha
They paid for your flight already, just snag that and never return
Live in Greece forever)

(Jesus Ryan)

(Just kidding mollie 🙄)

(Haha I could go off and be a fisherman)

(Haha aren't you already?)

(Change my name
Become a pagan)

(Mmm living the life)

(Pagan and a vegan)

(Mmm they go hand in hand)

(Degan)

(Never wear clothes)

(Pegan)

(I like that name)

(That'll be my name
Haha)

(It's a good one
I'll use it, if I ever write a fictional story 🙄
Hey

(Are you on your way?)

(Ugh no)

(Probably not till like 6 ish)

(I'm working on your present
It's not looking good)

(What?)

(Okay I will leave by 5)

(I thought there was no present
When are you gonna be here? My aunt and uncle want to see you)

(At the latest)

(Ryan)

(I'm the present mollie)

(Nnnnn)

(Haha jk)

(Haha)

(Ah no)

(No wonder it doesn't look good

(I can't show up
With a hurt ego)

(Aw ryan)

(Hey)

(Come innnnn)

(Hiiiiiii)

Idk if I spelled her name right 
But just say we hung out with her and Andrew or something)

(Well)

(Aww what)

(Fuck)

(I just got home)

(All I know)

(Well shit)

(Is there is going to be some severe consequence that we'll talk about more in the morning 
Rn it sounds like they're probably going to take my debit card away
But we'll see
Mom wants to take my phone
Dad wants to take the card
I don't really know)

(Because of tonight)

(Yeah)

(Ugh)

("Why are you coming home at 2"
"We just had this talk"
Literally though
Between when I said I won't be much long and when I showed up was exactly one hour
One measly hour
We got back at 1 am and spent one hour together)

(Happy 18th 😊)

(Haha)

(This is what adulthood feels like huh?)

(I've been in adulthood for years)

(Haha okay mollie)

(I just hopefully get some perks now
We'll see
Hey what's that wellsfargo app you have?
And do you need your card to use it?
Like with you?)

(Here's what you need to do right now
Take a picture of your debit card, front and back, right now
Just for peace of mind
And email those photos to yourself, which is secure don't worry
... in case they take your phone)

(Goddamn I love your brain)

(Yeah tell me about it)

(You can siphon off $5-10 every couple of days, and no one will notice
And since you're 18, you can even straight up deposit that into a private account
And your parents can't even look at it)

(Damn)

(Uh yeah that might be a bit too far haha 🙄)

(Alright then)

(But on Monday, straight up walk into BofA and open an account. It's nice to have something of your own)

(Haha I get that)

(Yeah haha no problem)

(We'll see I guess
Thanks though
Sorry everything gets so messy with me)

(I can deal with messes
Especially hot messes 😎🔥
Yeeee)

(Yeeeaaahhhhh)

(Good)

(Haha thanks
You make me feel better)

(That's what I want to hear
Makes me feel useful)

(Haha you are the most useful)

(Haha you make me smile so much)

(For fun for advice for everything 
For occasional tech support 
Never worry baby)

(Okay I know sometimes I say this without really meaning it
...
But you should go to bed)

(I know)

(Hey molllie)

(I was just about to say that

Take care of yourself)

(But at least I've got some freedom)

(Right)

(You could come see me)

(Haha)

(Hey mollie)

(I'm gonna write you a letter everyday
Would it be weird to have a ton of letters show up to your house?

(I'm a little better than you)

(It's not like it would be your fault 😂)

(Just be careful is all I'm saying)

(Hey

(I would think it was my fault)

(And so would your folks)

(I just speed when I'm angry or bored)

(Okay okay)

(Eh it's all good
They wouldn't think it's your fault
Calm down
Jesus have some faith
And don't jinx things)

(But I've seen you take some wild turns)

(Gosh if I knew you were paying so much attention I wouldn't have)

(Aww no)

(But I'm usually rushing with you cuz I'm stressed
Cuz we're not supposed to be together 😂)

(It's okay
Ugh frick)

(Don't worry about it)

(Why is this such a mess?)

(I'm perfectly capable)

(Yeah that's what makes it worth living)

(I don't know
Maybe life's just messy)

(Alright enough philosophical motivation
Sorry if I'm texting you too much 🙄)

(Hell yeah!)

(It's a long drive)

(Haha it's ok)

(I'm always happy to hear from you)

(Haha good)

(But I am at 3%
So it might not go much longer)

(I like deadlines...
Awww you're so sweet

(Ughhhhhh)

(I don't think you understand)

(Ryannnnn)

(I didn't know that was a thing)

(It took awhile though)

(You probably didn't get a good tip either)

(Haha it's not)

(I just did it)

(And I'm guessing the bill was under $15)

(Eh not really)

(Whatever)

(Don't do those ones haha)

(Nah it was like 27)

(You can reject them)

(Oh okay
That's good then
Higher bills tend to mean higher tips)

(*tend to)

(Yeah)

(Oh well)

(But mollie do you even know the tip amount?
Because it doesn't tell you until you end your session)

(I know it was like $3 😂)

(Hahaha well)

(La vida 
After all that)

(My first two sucked
But after that I was knocking out 2.5 per hour)

(I almost had this one done in 10 min)

(Also idk about daytime supply and demand, nighttime was night cause I was the only one pretty much)

(But the principal showed up)

(And now there's traffic)

(Haha well)

(Did you get a second one?)

(Yeah I might try more later tonight)

(Yeah I wasn't getting jobs until I went to those "hotspots")

(Not yet
Daytime is kinda finicky)

(Yeah exactly)

(As soon as I showed up, it gave me a job though)

(People just usually schedule the day though)

(Oh right)

(I think
Idk)

(I've never had to schedule
I just keep refreshing until it lets me join unscheduled)

(Pretty much 😂)

(Well good luck)

(Goddamn there's a lot of cars)

(I'm be out for a bit
Keep in touch and don't crash)

(Awww I live your letters no matter what)

(Awww)

(Love

They make me feel so close to you
So safe and happy
Idk the writing is just so easy for me to wrap my head around
It makes everything seem so clear)

(Note taken)

(You always were good at taking notes)

(That's actually a thing)

(Wait seriously for lesbians too?)

(Like how lesbians get turned on by the smell of other lesbians 
Pheromones 
100%)

(So that's like gaydar
But science)

(Right right)

(Haha I'm always curious how you would ask people out if you were gay)

(That's like how they find each other
Like that gut feeling you get 😂
No wonder nata so good at finding all these closet girls)

(Like how do you know?
That'd be so much rejection
Guess it's part pheromones

(Don't worry about it)

(Well shit okay)

(Not likes there anything you can do about it
It just is)

(Just give in like that)

(It's not giving in)

(Yeah idk)

(It's just accepting that there are some unknowns
And maybe that's the way it's supposed to be)

(I just try not to think about it)

(How in the world is that better than what u said)

(Woah really?)

(*i

(Hey I've got a question for you?)

(Yes we do modest

(Pretty unlikely)

(Oh good)

(Graphic drawn or written?😂)

(Yes
Both)

(Mmm courtesy of Michael I presume)

(Yeahhhh)

(Are the boys helping you craft love letters?)

(And others perhaps)

(Haha)

(More like lust letters)

(Ohhh yeahhh)

(Ugh whatever)

(Good. Maybe I'll get something quality then 
For once)

(So nothing showed up yet?)

(Haha idk we haven't gotten the mail)

Holding each other
Just rocking back and forth

Slowly
Passionately)

(Ohhh my god Ryan)

(Synced)

(Mmm I was gonna say kissing too)

(Mmm whispering in their ear)

(Ugh)

(Nibbling on the ear)

(UGH)

(Nibbling)

(So good)

(And stopping to whisper I love you
Every so often

Dumb boy)

(You like dumb?

(Awww)

(I want you so bad)

(I don't
🙄)

(You ass)

(Maybe)

(Whatever. I like myself 
And you keep coming back so you must like me a little)

(Or maybe I just like punishing myself)

(Right with my unbearable company)

(Well apparently you don't know me well enough if you thought it was sexual)

(You never get anyyyyyything you want
And I'm soooooo needy 
I am currently watching the spiciest show oh my god

(Hey after I brush my teeth can we talk? I really like talking with you)

(I'm definitely better)

(Oh)

(Haha yeah. I'm just driving home)

(Look at that video I sent you on instagram)

(Mmm)

(Jesus Christ)

(Ugh

Like all she wanted to do was help
And not only did she die
She got mangled
I feel so sad)

(I want to sleep)

(All she wanted to do was help)

(Fine)

(Sleep peacefully)

(What if I rouse you?)

(No more
Please)

(I need sweet things)

(Okay one shot)

(Haha
You can try)

(I'm roused)

(Uh?)

(I didn't even say anything)

(Yeah but I was thinking about what I said)

(Haha)

(Maybe it's your desperation)

(I thought desperation was a turnoff for girls
Mollie
I wanna hug you
And kiss you all over
Slowly
Slowly kissing lower and lower
Rubbing that area behind your thigh
Mmm
So ticklish
To feel close to you)

(Ohhh my god)

(And only I know that spot)

(But then I gently go down)

(Don't do this)

(And lick that special place)

(Up and down
Side to side
Gently swirling
At the same time
I'm holding your hand
Comforting you)

(Aw)

(Making you feel safe)

(Oh)

(And close)

(Slowly I kiss up
Higher and higher
To your neck
Underneath your chin
And nibble on those cute earlobes
And kiss your forehead
And finally
And slow and passionate kiss on the cheek
And the mouth
And I whisper, I love you
How's that?)

(I'm roused)

(Mollie no)

(Actually 
I'm gonna get off now)

(Save it 🙄
I'm saving it)

(You)

(Hahaha)

(Suck)

(Fine)

(Can you try?)

(I'll wait)

(Arouse me
Not gonna lie,)

(I'm sooo wet though)

(Typing that stuff kinda got me going to)

(Oh my turn?)

(Sooo wet
Now that's got me going
Yes)

(I feel like I kicked us off but I'll give it another shot)

(Please)

(I want you)

(God I want you so bad)

(Aww)

(I just wanna pull you up against my body and hold onto you)

(Ye)

(And feel your hands touch all over me)

(Yes)

(More
Mollie)

(Slide down my sides and up my chest)

(Ohh)

(And I'll lean in and kiss you)

(So softly on the lips)

(Oh Jesus Christ)

(The cheek)

(Down your neck and nibble on your ear)

(Oh frick)

(And whisper I love you
Sliding my hands down your chest to your belt)

(Not the belt mollie)

(Kissing down your body slowly, biting on your inner thigh while I reach up and just stroke you)

(Ohh frick)

(So gently and look up at you)

(Mollie
Ugh
I want it so bad
Your gaze)

(And while you're watching me)

(Aww)

(I lock eyes)

(Nooo)

(And slowly lean in and just kiss the tip)

(Too much)

(Frick)

(And open my mouth)

(I'd explode)

(No)

(And run my tongue over the top)

(Ugh)

(That'd feel amazing
I promise I'll save myself)

(Then just gently slide it into my wet mouth)

(So I can feel this good)

(One inch at a time)

(Oh
(So twice)
Hahaha)

(Until you're pressed against the back of my throat and I can't go any deeper)

(Oh frick)

(Mollie
I like you so much
So frickin much)

(And I tighten my lips around you)

(Ohh)

(And just slowly slide up and down across the thick middle section)

(Omg)

(Then pull all the way up and off)

(That works so well)

(Then push it back down into my hot mouth)

(Mollie I don't think you have any idea what you're doing to me rn)

(Slowly
So slowly and gentle)

(This is way better than I expect
Expected
I can't even type rn)

(All while I'm just petting your hip)

(I'm so hard)

(Ohh)

(And looking up at you)

(Ugh that's the last straw)

(Looking up to make sure you're ok)

(You have no idea how much I like that
Aww)

(And sliding my hand over to reach yours)

(Oh)

(Mollie)

(To just hold onto you and let you know it's ok)

(Oh mollie)

(And run my tongue all up and down the base)

(Before I kiss underneath it, all the way down to where I'm not supposed to go)

(You're so amazing)

(Oh frick
That feels so good
Really really good)

(And run my lips back all the way up to the tip)

(Ohh)

(And reach underneath and just hold onto you while I go back down)

(All good)

(Getting you wet so I can use my hands too
Mmmm how's that?
Boy?
Hello?)

(Omg so good
Mollie I love you so much
I can't say that enough
I can't)

(…did you save yourself?)

(Yeah)

(Haha)

(It's so hard mollie
Like rock solid
Ugh)

(I wanna touch it so bad)

(I wish you were in this bed beside me)

(So bad Ryan)

(Ugh)

(God if I could just sit on it)

(I wish I could just roll over to my left)

(Just a few times)

(And kiss you)

(And just feel how hard it is inside me)

(And do it)

(Ugh
Frick)

(It's so wet Ryan)

(That first time when you put tnin)

(It in
It's the best feeling the world
I just look at you
And know that it feels just as good
If not more, for you)

(It feels so good)

(Ugh frick)

(You make me feel so good
Better than anything else can
I can't even think)

(I know
It's the best
Omg
Just you
Only you can do it for me now
Ugh)

(I just want to sit)

(Porn doesn't even work anymore)

(And let it slide in)

(Ugh)

(Really really slowly)

(So nice)

(And face you)

(Aww)

(I love that one)

(And just feel your arms wrap around me and hold me against you)

(I love any position where I can just look at you)

(And watch your face)

(In the eyes)

(And see the pleasure
Ugh
Mollie this sucks)

(I want it so bad)

(Oh)

(I'm like uncomfortably wet
I just want to feel your hands reach over and touch me
And just know that you'll take care of me)

(Oh frick
I'd like that so much
I love just resting my head on your stomach
And getting you off
It's so much fun)

(Oh god)

(Especially when we can be as loud as we want)

(And you curl your fingers up and touch that spot)

(And there's no one home to worry about)

(And I can just feel your weight on me)

(Aww)

(And your warmth)

(Yes
Omg
The weight
It's amazing
I've never felt closer to someone)

(To just feel so safe and comfortable)

(Oh gosh)

(To just want to give them everything)

(Just to lay down sideways)

(Anything)

(Facing each other)

(And rocking back and forth slowly
Aww
With the lights out)

(With my legs wrapped around you)

(Oh my god)

(Oh frick
I literally flinched
When you typed that)

(And you pushing up into me)

(Oh frick)

(With your face against my body)

(Just teasing you)

(And me holding you there)

(Ohh)

(Frick
And you do that thing)

(And talking to you)

(Where you beg me)

(To go in more
Holy shit
I am way too aroused right now)

(Just give it to me)

(Way too)

(I want you)

(I'm so hard)

(So bad)

(So ducking hard)

(Oh Ryan)

(Fucking)

(Just put it in I can't take it)

(Ugh)

(I wish you were here
Oh my god
I want to get off with you so bad)

(Jesus Christ)

(I know I know I know)

(I just want to get off)

(It's so bad rn)

(Just reach your hand down)

(I wonder if in college)

(Just out a little pressure on it Ryan)

(We could get off via skype)

(I am)

(Like I do)

(Ugh)

(Oh)

(Ugh I can imagine exactly how it feels)

(I know)

(I'm imaging you rn)

(Put your hand down your pants Ryan)

(Snuggled up to me)

(Your head on my chest
Reaching down
And I'm reaching down too
Ok
Oh my god)

(And just slide your hand down really slow)

(Frick)

(Just feel it
Explore it)

(It's so hard)

(From the base to the tip)

(It's pulsing)

(Very gentle)

(Aw)

(Like I would)

(Oh frick)

(Mollie
Mollie we're doing that
At least once
Soon)

(Grip it)

(We're going to go in separate bathrooms, strip ourselves naked)

(Hold it tighter)

(And Skype each other
And get off together
Just to try it
Please
Mollie)

(Anything you want Ryan)

(You're gonna make me cum)

(Now grip it)

(Tight)

(Mollie shove your own fingers up your own pussy okay?)

(Right in the thick middle part)

(And slide your thumb up to the tip)

(And rub your clit)

(I am)

(Smooth
Circular)

(Ugh)

(Motions)

(And lick your fingers
And go back
And do it again)

(Oh my god)

(Mollie)

(Rub your thumb around the tip Ryan 
Run it over the edges very lightly)

(I wanna jack off so bad
So fucking bad)

(Hold it tight Ryan)

(Mollie no)

(And start slow
But just slide your hand up and down)

(I'm not finishing
No)

(It's ok)

(Oh frick I want this so bad)

(Just listen to me
Do what I say
It's ok Ryan)

(I can't
Mollie
Nope)

(Now start to move it a little faster ryan)

(Mollie no)

(Come on)

(From the base to the tip)

(Oh fuck)

(Move it faster Ryan
Fast like when you really give it to me
And I'm screaming because it feels so good I can't think
And my whole body is hot and arching underneath you)

(Mollie)

(Come on Ryan)

(I think I'm gonna go to the bathroom)

(And just do it)

(You can finish)

(It's not that bad if I finish)

(Cum for me)

(Right?)

(It's ok)

(Oh frick)

(I love it when you talk dirty
I'm not very good at it)

(Shh shh)

(You probably enjoy it just as much)

(Get up)

(I'll do it for you too)

(Oh frick)

(Go to the bathroom)

(Oh)

(Mollie
Ugh
So good right now)

(Just rub yourself through your pants)

(I told you to arouse me as a joke)

(Until you can slide them off like I do)

(But you actually did)

(You more than did it
Oh frick
I wish I had earbuds
I wish I could hear your voice)

(You know what I sound like)

(Ok)

(You know what I'm telling you)

(Right)

(Go do it Ryan)

(Okay it's okay)

(When I save up)

(It's ok baby)

(I just finish faster anyways)

(Which is bad for everyone)

(Go to the bathroom)

(Ok mollie)

(And just start by stroking yourself slow 
And think of me kissing your neck and ears and moaning to you 
About how good it feels when you let me sit on it  and it goes so deep 
So hot and wet)

(One sec
I went to the bathroom
I'm alone
All by myself)

(Read my texts)

(Oh frick)

(Just let yourself
Then reach in your pants Ryan
And grab it
Tight)

(Like you're in me)

(Don't stop)

(I'm setting my phone down 
For a second)

(Pushing up into me)

(Don't stop)

(Lie when I wrap my thighs around you and sit on it)

(Ugh)

(And it goes so deep and I can feel you pushing against my entrance 
And it's so hot and wet and tight 
And you just let me slide up and down slowly while you hold on 
And I lean forward and only put the tip in
Up and down on it
Before I push all the way back down and take it all)

(And bounce up and down on you)

(Oh mollie)

(Faster)

(Clenching around you)

(Holy shit)

(Wrapping my arms around your neck to go harder
Leaning in and tongue kissing you while I ride you
And I can feel you pushing all the way into me, hitting every spot 
Moaning into your ear about how much I love you)

(Okay
I'm fine
Done)

(Good boy)

(Dammit mollie)

(Why)

(You asked)

(Well)

(I could've been asleep 
But you asked
Was it good?)

(As good as it can get without you being here)

(I'll take it)

(Yes)

(Ok Ryan
I love you
But I really do need to sleep)

(Thank you)

(Yeah baby)

(Nighty night miss mollie)

(Anytime)

(Sleep well)

(Nighty night boy)

(It's my turn next)

(We'll see)

(Send me a good morning text tomorrow)

(Ryan I wanted it so bad
I could just imagine it so well
Jesus I live Seattle so freakin much
You lucky duck
Haha I almost went to school there

The Italian shop in there so so freakin good
Mmm and the yogurt right across the street

It's so good)

(Yogurt)

(It's right across from the pig)

(Pikes place)

(They scoop it into cups for you)

(Got it)

(Yes)

(And stick some gum in the wall for me)

(Mollie I miss you so much)

(On)

(I wish you were here with me)

(Aw ryan)

(I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself
After you're gone)

(Think of all the witty things I would be saying as I led you around the city)

(Oh frick)

(Aww

Me neither
You make me like everything so much more
You make me feel so safe
And so much braver)

(Mollie

Like you

(I know Ryan. You too)

(Okay I need to go)

(Ok. Go live an adventure)

(Text me out of the blue sometime)

(Take care of yourself)

(Okay)

Good luck)

(I did it I peed!)

Me
But I did it!
Now imma run out of here in triumph 
And hopefully not see anyone)

(They laughed?)

(They asked me if I could pee today)

(Mmm)

(It was the same people from this morning)

(You did it for me didn't you?
I'm so proud
What a good girl)

(That's all I wanted)

(Aww)

(For you to be proud)

(So sweet
Mollie I found the pig)

(Look directly across the street and probably a little bit to your right)

(Okay okay)

(There's a stand that you have to walk into a little bit and it's a bunch of yogurt that they scoop for you
I think like a yeti was their symbol or something 
The lemon and the berry ones are super good
Also I just landed a $45 order
Yayyyy)

(I'm gonna try it
If/when I see it
I just got a tomato Brie sandwich and it's great
Nice job girl, you've joined the working class
Okay not gonna lie, you taking the initiative and going through doordash's signup process on your own, is a huge turn on for me
I'm a little proud of you
Ugh is this what it feels like when I'm driving? And I don't text back 🙄)

(Haha yeahhhh)

(Psssh whatever)

(Ryan I've been doing job stuff all by myself all summer dumbass
Haha but I do like doordash 
Good luck)

(Not even doing well)

(Snuggled right up to me
So safe)

(Awww)

(And comfortable)

(And I lean over
And rub your head
So softly
And run my fingers through your hair
And I pause 
To kiss you
Slowly
On the lips
Our soft, soft lips
Slowly
And passionately
Hugging each other so hard it hurts
Just feeling close to another human
And I kiss you on the forehead
Once)

(Mmm our Bodies pushed up against each other)

(Twice)

(Three times
Yeahhh
Just grinding
And kissing)

(And slide your hands down my chest and over my body)

(Ugh)

(And I slide mine down)

(And rub your inner thigh)

(Why are you so much better? 😂)

(Haha)

(I need more specifics I think)

(It's a gift)

(What can I say)

(But I'm too modest to say)

(It's a god given talent)

(Mmm)

(How ironic)

(Not too specific)

(Idk)

(Just enough to let me know)

(Like)

(I'm better in person)

(Tactile words)

(Mmm)

(Actions)

(Pushing up into you)

(But simple ones)

(Teasing you)

(Making you want it)

(Mmm yeah)

(Just the tip)

(Like that)

(Hugging me tighter)

(Trying to pull me in
But I'm resisting
Just playing with you
And just when you want it the most, I push hard
Deep
Right into you
Your fingers digging into my hair 
My back
Everything
Rocking back and forth)

(Ohhh)

(Mmm)

(That's pretty god
Good)

(Learn from the best)

(😉 just trying to make this an overall ore enjoyable experience)

(Haha and I do that thing)

(Where I place your hands behind your head
And hold you there
While I push in
And out
Forcefully)

(Oh)

(But endearingly)

(Passionately
Gosh
With every push
So much love for you
Just wanting to make you feel good
My only purpose right now
In that night
Stroking your hair
Putting pressure on your entire body
You're just opening up to me
And I'm savoring every moment)

(Ok)

(Frick)

(Too specific)

(Mollie)

(Haha)

(This is not my thing)

(But I like it)

There's no pretending)

(You don't need sexy for that)

(Yeah it's exactly how I feel)

(Just you
You're enough)

(Haha aww
Thanks
Okay 1%)

(Ok)

(Aww)

(I love you
Stay safe)

(Sleep well)

(Okay yeah you too)

(Ugh don't reread those other texts
They're sooo weird
Eww)

(Um)

(I'm sorry)

(I'll do what I damn please)

(Okay)

(Just write me a story)

(Okay last text I promise)

(Still here)

(Aww)

(Frick
Dammit
I want to leave you a text and not have you respond)

(Ok)

(Fine well now that I know you're here)

(I'll wait)

(Awww Ryan)

(Oh mollie)

(What is it baby?)

(I love you so much
It hurts so fucking bad
Literal tears are running down my cheeks I'm so frustrated
I don't know what's wrong with me
I'm sorry)

(I think you're experiencing cognitive dissonance)

(Mollie I don't think you understand)

(I think you've always live in an environment that doesn't reward love or empathy and you built your person around that)

(I want to stop feeling)

(I think that your paradigm still hasn't completely shifted enough to accept me and my eventual loss into your life)

(No)

(Ugh)

(Mollie this is bad
All my friends literally walked in the room to talk with me)

(You want to stop feeling conflicted over something you cannot consciously control)

(And I had to pretend I was tired and asleep)

(What?)

(So they wouldn't see)

(What did they want?)

(I'm so depressed ugh)

(What just to hang out and talk like normal)

(Oh ok)

(Mollie I can't)

(No ryan
Listen
To what I'm saying here)

(I just can't anymore
I just want it all to end
I just want to be sad and alone
That was the best)

(No you don't)

(And I know you hate to hear it)

(You want to go back to that?)

(But drinking is so nice)

(It helps)

(To crying yourself to sleep every night?)

(I stop feeling)

(It's so nice)

(To always feeling guilty like you had something to hide?)

(I don't feel this gnawing pain all day)

(Oh Ryan)

(Mollie I've been so distant to my friends)

(I feel like they're gonna leave me
I want them to
So I can be alone
I just want to be alone
I don't know why I'm texting you
I don't know what I'm expectir
Expecting)

(You're leaving a door open)

(Yeah a bit I guess)

(You're wanting someone to care enough to try and believe in you)

(Frick mollie
You're tearing me in half
It hurts so bad
So bad)

(I told you already)

(But I just want to hug you)

(And make you feel safe
And you make me so happy)

(You need to expand your paradigm ryan)

(When you're right there beside me)

(Oh baby)

(You do)

(I don't even know what you mean by paradigm)

(It's your brains allowance for existence)

(You might as well be recycling knowledge you pick up from your own therapist)

(You probably are
I'm too sad
And depressed)

(You think Susan knows what a paradigm is?)

(And too much to put up
With)

(Give me some fucking credit)

(Just go already)

(Ugh I'm orry
Sorry)

(Shut the fuck up and listen to me you add)

(I don't know why I get this way)

(Ass)

(Awww
Frick
Now you've done it
Mollie I'll stop being a bitch
Just go to bed
I'll deal with it)

(No)

(Don't worry about it)

(You'll listen to what I have to say and actually ingest some of it dammit)

(Okay that's enough)

(Pay attention to me Ryan I'm not just a body
It hurts because it's foreign and possibly harmful but it's also fulfilling a need that has never been met for you
So half of you needs it
And the other half is trying to protect you because love has never been rewarded in your life before
It's the natural part of you
And the learned behavior
It's cognitive dissonance
People can't handle living in the undecided
The universe can't stay in a state k possibilities. Pretty soon everything either is or isn't. And the longer that takes, the more unstable everything gets 
That's how your brain is
You're trying to live in two incompatible worlds 
And the friction in between them is what's hurting you)

(Are you here with me?)

(It makes a lot of sense)

(Dammit Ryan I know I started rambling but at least tell me you get some of that)

(I'm sorry
But knowing why, doesn't really help me that much
It still hurts)

(The why is everything Ryan)

(I still feel like running away half the time)

(The why is the part that tells you how it works)

(And the other half, I feel so attached and trusting)

(And how you can manipulate it)

(Okay I'm sorry and I'm going to leave now)

(Wait Ryan)

(I hate doing this, but I can't help it, and I find myself in the same position again and again)

(I love you)

(I'm a mess)

(I'm sorry it hurts)

(Sure)

(I love you too)

(But you keep running in this circle)

(Mollie I just want out)

(You can't get anywhere until you leave)

(Whatever that takes)

(I just want to go to college and forget)

(I'll do it)

(You're going)

(Oh mollie)

(I'm going
I'll go now if that's what you want)

(I don't want that
Do you?
Maybe you'd be better off
I think about that sometimes
Maybe you could do better
Ugh I'm saying too much now
Okay I'm leaving
Bye)

(People tend to always do about right)

(Do about right?)

(Goodnight Ryan
Sweet dreams)

(In terms of love)

(Right right)

(The brain is a wonderful matchmaker)

(So our brains like each other
Great)

(Idk my vagina kinda likes you too)

(Hahaha yeah)

(The sex is pretty amazing too
Ugh
You always know how to make me smile
So witty)

(So witty)

(Dammit mollie)

(So pritty 
Wish she would sitty 
On me)

(Haha Jesus Christ
Oh mollie)

(Jealous of my raw talent?)

(Yeah a bit)

(Okay
Goodnight for real)

(Ok for real)

(Hmm?)

(Go rub one out and think about me
And sleep dammit
Guess what I just found
I'm out big laundry pile of hand washables
*in our
That someone grabbed and brought down to wash
You just had a kickass day in Seattle
You need some rest)

(What
Oh damn nvm, I know now 😊
Hey mollie?)

(Yeah?)

(Can you send me a picture of yourself?)

(Like a selfie on Snapchat)

(Uhhh yes?)

(Uh don't freak out or anything)

(Any particular reason why?)

(But I haven't been feeling the best lately)

(Ryan?)

(Idk just really bad depression for the past couple of days)

(And I feel like crying constantly
It's bad
Even when hanging out with my best friends and sick there's
Six others
I just wanted to see you again)

(Sometimes being with people made it worse for me)

(Yeah a lot actually)

(Aw baby
You'll see me soon
Do you wanna talk?)

(But we're about to leave
I get frustrated on how much I need you
Your voice is so comforting. It doesn't really matter what you're saying)

(Do you want a call?)

(I forgot about this song, but it came on the radio)

(Good boy Eddie!
https://9gag.com/gag/ar5MnE0?ref=ios.s.sms
You should get a dog when you're older)

(https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ty31QY5ZGHo)

(Awww thanks boy)

(I'm feeling so much better)

(Just thought I'd let you know)

(Awww)

(Maybe I really am bipolar idk)

(It was that Chinese cake
Good)

(Oh well)

(Honestly)

(Hey)

(I was gonna say
That)

(Is that a turnoff? 🙄
Mental disorders)

(Apparently not for you)

(Haha yeah)

(Haha)

(You've got your stuff too)

(But I make up for it with my boyish good looks)

(Hey can we talk for a bit?)

(I'm okay
I just want to hear your voice again)

(Aww Ryan)

(Okay call me when you're free)

(Yeah. I'm just pickin up joe rn and taking him home)

(Oh gosh I love your voice so much)

(Haha really?)

(Ugh mollie if you called earlier)

(it's so weird when someone likes your voice 
Gosh I hate it
Haha
Ok 
I'll call)

(I would have talked more
I wanted to)

(Stupid boy)

(Before 11, I'm gonna call you again)

(Haha it's ok
I still like hearing your voice)

(So expect that)

(Haha ok Ryan)

(Holy crap)

(Dammit you made me mess up on Tetris)

(Mollie I have a great
Great idea
We are going to play Tetris
Together
Remotely
Tonight)

(Haha really?)

(Nah)

(Like over the app?)

(Remember when we played on the computer)

(Yeah)

(That version)

(But how?
A site?)

(Mmm ok)

(Through my server)

(It should be reasonably soon though if you want tonight
And yet I shower and get into bed no promises boy)

(I'd have to walk you through how to login and everything
Maybe even share my secret password 🙄)

(Ooh Jesus)

(Okay let's try)

(The secret password)

(Idk how it's gonna work out
But if you're free, goto google chrome and search for "chrome ssh" and download that extension)

(Wait does this have to be on a computer?)

(Yeah)

(But nvm)

(Um)

(I'm at a skatepark rn)

(No puedo)

(What)

(I can't)

(Okay mollie I need to go)

(Were you drinking?)

(Oh hmm, they just say unopened
Okay that's what I was going to ask you
Honestly that's a relief that you can't go)

(Why?)

(Oh jeez, mom woke me up today and was like "you gotta text mollie, so we can go to the market")

(I really wanted to)

(I just figured it would be kinda weird, but okay)

(Awww)

(Hey do you wanna do something today?)

(I'd like that)

(Me too. Let's go on an adventure, for real this time)

(Hey is everything all right?)

(Huh?)

(Maybe I'm way off the mark)

(But you've seemed a tiny bit distant lately)

(You're not)

(Oh mollie)

(I'm not exactly sure 
I think maybe my mind's just kind of getting me ready to leave)

(I just want to make you feel better)

(I don't really think I feel bad)

(Mollie you've been vague and just a tiny bit off putting)

(I just feel
Separate)

(Ever since about a week ago
I hope you're okay)

(I think I am)

(Oh damn okay)

(I think I might just need a change)

(Well I'll leave it at that for now
But I really want to see you, more than usual today, just to hold you and talk)

(Really?)

(Yeah of course)

(Mollie if there's something I can help with, please please let me know)

(Alright Ryan)

(Okay okay)

(Let's just see each other today
And do something)

(When?
I'm free until about 7)

(Uh)

(Okay when's Susan again?)

(I think I have to drop joe off at like 4)

(12)

(Well what if you just hung out at my place until 11:30... it's on your way right?)

(So I leave at like 11:30)

(We could go on a walk
Or just cuddle
Whatever you want girl)

(Hmmm)

(Nope)

(Ok then
Let me get dressed
Ok
Do you still want me?)

(Well)

(Haha of course I do)

(Okay)

(Okay I can do that)

(Keep in mind that the high is 68)

(Jesus Christ I get it)

(I'll wear warm clothes
And bring my parka

I love you.

(The messages are so sad rhan 
Ryan

(You broke up with me)

(Uh)

(I don't remember that
I was probably just joking right
Yeah)

(You don't joke drunk)

(Okay but don't get the wrong message)

(I don't want that)

(I know)

(Hey how is that official? 🙄)

(Haha werre officially not a couple
Just a couple of horny teenagers sneaking around)

(Drunken actions are sober thoughts)

(Ugh)

(Who said that?
I wonder now…
Haha)

(Rules don't apply to me)

(So you've said)

(Jesus I just read them)

(Probably not the best mindset
But maybe it'll help you be successful
We'll see)

(Oh god

(Soooo sad)

(Are we okay though?)

(Me too

But it might help the case)

(Yes okay

(I get that for sure)

(Just when they leave, i think about how much more I could've done with them)

(Aww Mollie)

(I'm never gonna have that again)

(Don’t look at it that way
Think about all the happy memories
And the sad ones
And the ones that just happened
And appreciate what happened)

(I can't help but think about all the ones that didn't happen)

(Just that fact that it happened)

(Nah)

(And all the ones that were because of you)

(Don’t do it)

(That's all)

(Hmm?)

(All the ones that didn't happen Ryan)

(Way to guilt me Mollie)

(They were because of you)

(I’m sorry)

(Sorry I didn't mean to do that)

(Aww well now you’re just putting me through a roller coaster of emotions)

(It was my choice don't feel bad
If anything you should feel honored)

(I'm sorry)

(Okay okay)

Idk I think we're ok
He kinda already knew cuz he could tell I was hungover)

(I hope everything works out in the end)

(I think it will)

(But we’re doing that at least once before you go
I like feeling small and unimportant and content)

(Yeah me too)

(Hey Mollie don’t worry about that)

(Very calming
Were you looking up stuff on my phone the other night 
Lord Ryan it was scary stuff
Don't do anything stupid)

(I wasn’t completely lucid)

(Do you remember?)

(And was probably shooting for attention)

(It’s okay
I remember typing that)

(Yeah probably but what's wrong?)

(Please don’t worry about it)

(Do you feel like I'm ignoring you?)

(Nothing’s wrong)

(Nononono I don’t think that
You aren’t
You’re wonderful and great and everything that I could have ever hoped for)

(Awww Ryan)

(Aww frick really?)

(I just wanted to be sure
I'm sorry if I was
I love having you around)

(I know it’s probably true)

(Haha yeah I wish you were here now)

(But hearing it is so lifting)

(Awww I'm sorry)

(Oh gosh Mollie)

(I should tell you more)

(You’re so good to me
Thank you
Also next movie: iron giant
I’m ready, let’s go girl)

(Ryan jacobs did you read my notebook)

(What?)

(I just pulled it out to look)

(And someone left me a note)

(No I didn’t even know you had one)

(What?)

(In sloppy cursive)

(Really!)

(Dammit
?
No I don’t think so)

(You little stinker)

(Holy crap)

(You did
It was a goodbye note I started when you first talked to me)

(I’m sorry
Mollie
I swear I have no recollection of any of that
I didn’t even know you had a notebook)

(Hmmm)

(But yes)

(That was definitely me
I don’t remember doing that)

(I wonder if you were drunk)

(More than likely)

(That was probably during one of those two nights at your place
A while back
But dammit
I have no memory of that)

(Hmmm)

(I don’t want it right now)

(I wonder if I should give it to you)

(Please don’t do that)

(You'll get it eventually)

(Can I have my birthday card first?)

(Haha)

(The card?)

(Yeah but let's get that damn board
Hey I'll tell you what
Come over tonight
And I'll give it to you)

(Yep)

(https://www.amazon.com/FORESTONE-Warning-Skateboard-Natural-8-0inch-Deep/dp/B00GYPM4O0)

(A plain skateboard deck btw
Perfect for sharpie art and writing)

(Holy shit)

(Can you throw this in too? 🙄)

(Good boy
I'm ordering it now)

(https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0039ZN00K/ref=pd_aw_sim_468_2/141-6586800-3131831?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=7QK6P6Z9NZ1KM7HHPNCK&dpPl=1&dpID=91bOFGUCrfL&th=1#nav-search-keywords)

(Haha)

(Mollie put them in the same cart)

(Yeah sure
Aw crap
Ok that might be slightly later because it's only five bucks)

(Then they show up together
It’s an add-on item)

(I already bought the damn board)

(That was fast)

(I know)

(It's ok I'll just buy something else)

(Hey now)

(Yeah one click)

(Don’t do that)

(No)

(Eh)

(That’s stupid)

(We can walk into a shop
And they’ll do it with labor for about $10
So it’s either $5 and you do a crappy job cutting the tape
Or let them do it)

(Yayyyy)

(So do you really think you can get free tonight? 🙄)

(Uhhh)

(Carpool?)

(Idk
I'd honestly rather maybe do this a little later
But idk)

(Wait nvm I gtg
I’ll text you later
But your house is on my way to Hannah’s
Maybe that’s a bad idea idk
Okay back)

(Is there any hope for the laptop)

(Yeah actually there’s one last ditch effort)

(But I need to go to Starbucks to download this 4 GB file
Aww girl you can’t come?
Mollie talk to me baby)

(Oh whoops)

(Yeah I’m stubborn)

(No
Awww you're going. All the way out there?
Baby)

(Dammit
Why can’t you come?
It’s so close to you
It’s like a five minute drive - or less than that
When’s your aunt coming?)

(Mmm papa doesn't want me to go anywhere since my aunt is coming)

(Chris?)

(Not for a bit 
Idk I'm afraid to kick the hornets nest
She's like 8:40
I think)

(Yep)

(But wait)

(That means you can at least see everyone for an hour and a half)

(But)

(Frick)

(They don't want me to leave
Then maybe be late
I think
Idk they just don't know when she's getting here)

(And I think if she finds out that I'm leaving soemthing for here she'll feel bad)

(Yeah I hope so too)

(I'm hoping they'll agree to another one)

(We’re kinda running out of days)

(Yeah really)

(Ugh)

(And game nights just sound so fun
So easy)

(I’m sorry
I wish you could go
I love going to these things and having you with me)

(Shhhhh)

(Haha maybe a bit 🙄)

(Haha showing me off?
Haha me too
But stop
It's just gonna make me feel worse)

(But honestly I just like being around you. And it makes me more open)

(Yeah you get a little bolder)

(Yeah mmm hmm)

(Anyone does with a hot piece on their arm 🙄
😂😂😂 haha)

(Who’s the hot piece?
So you’re saying you can’t even leave right now to meet me at Starbucks?
Dammit)

(Haha anyone I'll be seen with in public)

(I haven’t really seen you for like two days)

(You might be able to swing by the house real quick but that's up to your schedule)

(Aww Mollie)

(Idk
Sorry baby)

(Bad timing
Okay so in no circumstance, even if your aunt Chris gave her utmost blessing, could you leave?)

(No)

(After a solid two hours of socializing with her)

(That would be so rude)

(Okay fine)

(It would be so hurtful)

(I get that)

(That is not graceful)

(Okay I’m sorry)

(I won’t push anymore)

(It's ok)

(Have fun with her)

(Be nice
Tell her I said hi)

(I'm so nice)

(Maybe I’ll stop by later)

(Aww)

(Yayyy)

(And drop off your (hopefully working) laptop)

(Movie night)

(Yayyyyy)

(Aww I do try)

(YAYAYAY
Good boy
You're my favorite)

(Sometimes
Okay I’ll check in with you later
Meanwhile I have a salad to demolish
Oh yeah, I went running for the first time in like 3 weeks
And I feel amazing)

(Me toooo)

(I’m back to the old me)

(Hahaha
Yeah)

(And low key kinda nasty but whatever)

(For a bit)

(Haha)

(No shower?)

(Good)

(Uhhh)

(That’d be rude to your aunt)

(Eventually)

(Borderline hurtful
And definitely not graceful)

(Shut up)

(Okay see ya)

(I taught you those)

(I love Mollie
I really do
Be good)

(Haha)

(Aww Mollie)

(Love you too baby

(More than likely)

(No it's ok)

(Aww frick

How are you baby?)

(I know I left you a little raw I'm sorry)

(It’s okay)

(Well)

(This one)

(Makes sense)

(Okay
No special last ditch date then)

(Apparently)

(Alright fine with me)

(Not on Sunday at least)

(Is she better now? After venting?)

(No)

(Dammit)

(She's just angry because she's up writing a eulogy and all that)

(Ugh)

(It wasn't me that much she's just very stressed)

(We did nothing wrong)

(Right
Okay
Not her fault)

(Idk papa just wasn't that specific so I assumed it was fine)

(Yeahhh)

(He didn't seem to care just now at all
Mom said he was mad but I kinda doubt it)

(I wish she were calmer)

(And it’s not like we stayed out to do it or anything)

(We just hung out and had fun)

(I know. It was so nice)

(What does she gain from keeping you in?)

(She tried to say I wasn't even at the fair)

(What)

(Idk)

(Frustration)

(Jesus Christ)

(What does she want?)

(Control)

(I mean would she be happier if you never left)

(Idk)

(And stayed in all the time)

(Just a calmer life I think)

(Yeah I get that)

(I did that for awhile and they got mad
When I was super depressed)

(Jesus that was horrible)

(Sometimes it’s like a game of chase)

(Like in elementary school
They’re so focused on chasing, even if there isn’t a reason to
And when you stop)

(Yeah maybe)

(They stop)

(Lord)

(And no one knows what’s going on)

(But nobody wins)

(So they panic)

(Ugh)

(And they try putting it back in motion. To aggravate something into normalcy again)

(That’s what happens if you stay in)

(Yeah you're kinda right)

(Yeah)

(It's not like I'll do anything
I'll just lay around
And get back into all my bad habits)

(Jesus ok I need to shower)

(For sure)

(Haha okay)

(I'll check in on you again before I sleep ok?)

It was terrible. They were mad about you and everything and Mom pretty much said she wouldn't pay for college if I ever made a decision like that again
Dad says he doesn't dislike you he just doesn't like all the things you do
Just
God I don't know
I think they just kinda want us to be done)

(Would you be okay with doing this over the phone?
I don’t know
I feel kinda sick
I’m sorry)

(I don't know if they'll come back or not)

(Wait)

(I just want to sleep forever)

(I wish I could take it back)

(I just wanted to hold you tonight
And cuddle)

(Don't)

(And make you feel happy before you left)

(I’m sorry)

(Please don't)

(That was mean)

(I just want to go to bed now)

(Okay)

(But hang on
So every single family member is home rn)

(Yes Ryan)

(No one is going to show up to my house)

(Okay
I’m sorry)

(It's almost midnight Jesus)

(I don’t know how to fix this)

(They were just coming to get me)

(But I’ll think of something)

(Oh)

(I don't think it can be)

(Nope)

(It just is)

(Bullshit
You’re wrong about that)

(Maybe. I'd like to be)

(There has never been something I couldn’t fix)

(But I'm so tired now)

(Im gonna sleep I think)

(*that I really wanted to)

(I know boy)

(Okay goodnight)

(Idk. People hit a wall eventually)

(Hahaha nope)

(But good luck anyways)

(Okay goodnight)

(Sorry about our last night)

(I’m waking up at 7)

(Guess that was yesterday)

(And I’m going to see you)

(Oh wait)

(Shoot the one before)

(At some point)

(Ok boy)

(I’m going to hug you again)

(Good luck)

(So hard)

(You won’t breathe
Nighty night girl)

(Nighty night)

(Hey)

(Good morning beautiful
Lord still asleep? What in the world were you doing)

(I may have made a really big mistake
Ugh)

(What)

(It’s embarrassing)

(Ryan what did you do?)

(And I’m scared)

(Oh god)

(Hey is everything okay with your parents?)

(Ryan
What did you do)

(I’ll tell you in a bit)

(Yeha pretty much I think)

(Did they talk to you at all?)

(No ryan
I'm so anxious now my stomach hurts
Tell me)

(Last night yeah but this morning Mom just did the whole do you understand why I do these things thing)

(Can you leave the house? 🙄)

(Ifk
Ryan what happened
Ryan
Dammit don't do this
Cmon what's going on)

(I'm not really sure)

(Uh)

(Why
What's going on)

(I just don’t want to face your parents)

(Yeah yeah I know)

(Uh okay)

(I don't think they'll talk to you 
Papa isn't even home today
But tell me what happened
I'm so anxious now)

(￼
I have no idea if they read it. Or if it was even the right email. But I wrote a very transparent, guilty, and depressing letter trying to win some sort of sympathy idk. I was really out there again. I’m sorry
I feel sick)

(Woah)

(todd.harmon@ncbb.net)

(What did you send it to
Awww Ryan
I can't believe you put yourself out there like that
Are you ok baby? Who did you send it to?)

(I admitted to so much
I don’t feel good)

(Ok it's possible he hasn't checked yet because he left so early)

(I just wanted to convince them they I’m not a bad person)

(I can probably delete it)

(Idk)

(They don't think you are baby)

(Would this help my case at all?)

(You're just a teenage boy that's all)

(You said they wanted us to split)

(I really don't know)

(It might freak them out)

(Okay)

(They expect it I think)

(But I still feel guilty for not talking to them more)

(Idk. They just want me to go to school and make soemthing of myself you know)

(I know)

(I’m sorry)

(It's ok. I know you were just trying to help)

(Hahahaha)

(Did you do all this sober?)

(Ha)

(Yeahhhh)

(What do you think girl?)

(I have a problem
Whatever)

(I still had to ask)

(I’ll get over it)

(Pretty good righting tho)

(Not sure that's how this works but ok)

(Writing)

(It was pretty good)

(I'm gonna go try to destroy it)

(Yeah idk)

(I was really focused
It took me forever)

(I almost feel bad deleting it)

(It’s okay)

(Half of me wants them to see it
Half of me is scared of rejection)

(What do you want me to do?)

(That’s why I did it)

(Idk
I think maybe you should leave it)

(Ok Ryan)

(What do you think?)

(I'll leave it)

(I don't know if it really matters anymore)

(What you think? Or what to do?)

(I mean, either at this point)

(Aww Mollie)

(I'm leaving in less than a day)

(Crazy)

(Yup)

(This time tomorrow I'll be gone)

(So I can shower and be ready for anything by 12:30
What do you want?
Hey
So who’s all taking you to the airport?)

(Ok Mom said this afternoon)

(This afternoon what)

(But it kinda sounds like I'm a little bit on house arrest rn
I'm sorry boy)

(You could come over)

(Oh)

(I really wanted to walk the train tracks again)

(Hey you know what)

(Same
Look I don’t care what happens
It can’t get much worse
Just give that letter to your mom and see what happens
I just want to know
And I want them to know I’m sorry)

(You want me to print it rn and give it to her?)

(Can you do that?)

(Ryan)

(And tell her I’m sorry
Yes)

(Without papa to temper this it might freak her out)

(Uh really?)

(She's really touchy about alcohol and stuff)

(Ugh fine
Nvm then)

(I think maybe)

(But now she really doesn’t like me for yesterday)

(One topic last night was me having too much power in our relationship)

(I thought transparency was a good thing)

(What
What do you mean?)

(Which I don't really think is true but she thinks I'm taking advantage of people)

(What)

(How?)

(And fostering unhealthy relationships)

(Mollie)

(Hey
What do you mean?)

(Idk but it started to freak me out)

(Haha yeah)

(I don't take advantage of you do I?
Every time you send me drunk stuff I always give it back no matter wha
T
I try to do what you want too)

(No you don’t
Not in the slightest
I’m not sure what you mean)

(Which part?)

(*they mean)

(Whoops)

(Oh)

(Oh)

(I think they're just scared for your heart)

(And scared that I'll get addicted to power)

(Yeah me too)

(Okay not that second one)

(But I'm scared for my heart too)

(Mollie it’s fine)

(No one thinks about that)

(I don’t think you can do much to me)

(Awww)

(Yeah)

(Ok ok)

(Yeah okay sure)

(Idk I'm cleaning some stuff up in my room rn
But can we like play or something today?
Idk I wanna play games or like soccer or with the hoses or soemthing)

(Idk)

(But railroad tracks for an hour sounds pretty perfect)

(I just wanna have fun like we were last night)

(I know)

(It reminded me of being little)

(Okay)

(I know boy
I'll do my best but I don't want to hurt anyone
Ok and if you do come over
Can I ask you to do me a teeny tiny favor?
Since I can't leave the house)

(Remember that photo I needed printed at Walmart?)

(Yeah a while back?)

(I forgot about it and never picked it up but I need it to give to noa)

(Holy crap that was a while ago)

(Noah
Could you get it for me?)

(Yeahhhh)

(Yeah)

(I just remembered yesterday)

(I doubt they still have it tho)

(I can send it to you to reprint)

(They normally toss them every 7 days)

(Okay)

(Yeah)

(Can you just print it)

(Thank you boy)

(And I’ll pick it up?)

(Huh?)

(Uhhh)

(Oh right okay)

(I don't know)

(How?)

(Just send it to me)

(Ok 😂 thank you smarties pants)

(Uh maybe not the last one)

(￼￼￼￼Hahaha can you actually get all of these 😂
I live these photos
Love)

(Just print those ones small)

(So what)

(Like Polaroid size haha
Just so I can have it 
Pleaassseeee)

(Patton gift to me?)

(What’s the order?)

(Uhh)

(Okay)

(Too two normal
Bottom ones are for me I don't care)

(Hey uh
I’ve decided
Maybe it’s too late
It probably is
But can you try to delete that email?
Pleaaaaseere)

(Yeah)

(Thanks)

(You know
I’ve realized something kinda
Sad
I don’t think we’ll be able to go to auburn house again will we?)

(I've been thinking about that too)

(No way in hell you’re escaping today?)

(I don't think so
We had our last time and didn't even know it)

(I just want one last time
A good one)

(It really doesn't seem like it but I can't tell right now)

(Ugh I just want to put every ounce of passion and caring into one hour)

(I know me too)

(And give it to you)

(Jesus I know I know)

(Haha well it’s synced to his phone most likely)

(Shhh
I know
Ok sooo
I can't get into the email
The computer won't even open the email app
But at least that means no one else can get in rn)

(Oh well
What’s done is done
I’ll just deal with the embarrassment
And being kicked out of your life)

(I really doubt he'll check on his phone)

(Hey girl)

(Maybe you can try when you come over ifk
Sorry boy)

(Do you know what comes out every Sunday?)

(I knooowwwww)

(So what time are you thinking?)

(One good thing today
Bless up)

(And also what’s the status on dinner 🙄)

(Uhhh. I think just about anytime now is fine)

(Steak)

(I've cleaned off the desk I'm just kinda moving a few things around in my bags now
Dinner?)

(I can't)

(Okay so who’s home and how angry are they)

(Tell the boys sorry
Sorry boy)

(Just Mom and Audrey)

(Like when I walk in and say hi. I have to say sorry too?)

(Mom is workin in the other room she doesn't seem that angry she's not paying attention to me
Papa and joe won't be back until like 4 at least)

(Like how pissed were they?)

(They were pissed at me last night)

(I’m not sure if I’m over exaggerating)

(At you)

(I don't think so)

(Or me)

(Or both)

(Me)

(Because of the Instagram)

(You're just a dumb teenage boy to them)

(Oh good)

(Lucky you)

(That’s the way I like it honestly)

(Well crap)

(Yeah me too)

(Let’s get rid of that email soon?)

(It's ok boy)

(Idk
I don’t want to scare them)

(Yeah I guess)

(Okay)

(I can't open it on the computer at all
So at least they can't see it)

(I’ll probably show up at 2:30isb
I just need to eat)

(Ok boy just let me know)

(Yeah I know)

(Good boy)

(Okey dokey)

(That was my plan haha)

(Hey boy, they're not too keen on you going to the airport with us so maybe you just come visit for a very little bit and we go ok?)

(I didn’t want to go to the airport)

(Ohhh ok)

(Cause then I have to ride back)

(Whoops that would've helped your case 😂)

(I just wanted to hug goodbye and go back to sleep)

(Haha sorry)

(Well tell them that dammit)

(Anyways

I’m so tired
Can you come out?
I don’t really want to go in)

(Yeah ok boy)

(We can hug for maybe ten minutes then I’ll head out)

(Ok ok)

(Idk what that was from haha)

(￼Look what just popped up
Something tells me someone wanted some attention)

(I have no recollection of that)

(Yeah but that's pretty normal)

(Uh I think I would’ve know that)

(Haha)

(You probably hit some button on accident
￼
I haven’t been here since I was 10
I’m just sitting here. Waiting so I can get a smoothie, maybe)

(Awww Papa and I used to go there)

(Anything for you baby)

(Thanks for seeing me boy)

(Ugh I'm gonna miss that cuddling)

(I wanted that bull)

(Yeah perhaps
Did you bring yours?)

(Noah's at least)

(Okay well now I have to)

(Yes I did)

(Ugh Ryan my internet
I can't load the stupid thing but I want it for the flightttt)

(Then charge your debit card the $8 fee. Honestly it’s worth it isn’t it? In the scale of everything, $8 is nothing)

(It's got a 45 min limit)

(Not if you pay $8...)

(Stupid wifi
It is very good though)

(Uggghhhhhh)

(Good guy Germany)

(Europe knows what it’s doing when it comes to socialism and free stuff)

(This airport is so nice)

(WiFi is free everywhere)

(Our airports are so nasty in comparison)

(Yeah I know)

(It's sad)

(And our public transit sucks)

(Ugh)

(Mollie I’m so sleepy)

(Freakin America 
Let's just stay in Europe awhile)

(I stayed up until 4
But I set an alarm so I could talk to you)

(Mmm be safe girl 🙄)

(Finally)

(The first page all that time ago)

(Yeah that’s what it seemed like)

(Like. One of our very first dates)

(Aww you write more

(It's ok I got this

(And so hurt
Just please be safe for me at least
Mollie when you get a little tipsy, you start taking your shirt off

(Think how I would feel)

(Mollie I wouldn’t in a million years)

(I know boy 
I'll take care of myself
You do too ok?
I've got a lot of faith in you)

(It’s just different)

(No boy I know)

Just please keep in touch
You can tell me anything. It’s okay)

Mine chipped his leg on the way over but there's wire inside so I kinda bent him back into place
Hopefully it's not an omen
Ok ok
But seriously get that stuff

(My data sucks here)

(Oh my god that looks terrible)

(Oh hey there)

(Wow)

(I have a shit ton of food)

(What’s a 2 dollar euro thing?
Also phone calll?
Via FaceTime audio if you have WiFi)

(It just cost me $2 to get a euro with like fries and  everything inside)

(Dammit)

(It’s spelled
Gyro

Moron)

(The people are really nice, like they're giving us free water and stuff)

(Hehe)

(Ah shit)

(Sorry, I was thinking of the money)

(It’s all good)

(Shut up)

(Haha what time is it there?)

(Okay yeah I definitely will snag that tomorrow)

(Sweet dreams
Papa says whenever. I think he put it on the porch)

(Also
I need to sleep
So much stuff to do. I can’t)

(Ryan)

(Aww dammit)

(Sleep now
Then just pack up
It's not that hard you don't have a lot you need to bring. You can get school stuff down there 
Also boy idk if you kept texting me but I had to put this chip in
Sorry if you thought I was ignoring I have to figure out the card
I have a euro and 72 cents)

(I figured)

(Sorry baby)

(Hey baby)

(Cmon
Okay Mollie)

(Hi hi)

(Oh woah)

(Ryan I fixed my card all myself)

(I forgot you ran out of data)

(And now I have money
Yayyy)

(An a running friend)

(Hey good girl)

(Wow)

(And a boy that keeps asking about you which is funny)

(Sound like a good day)

(Hahaha)

(Ughhhhhhhh)

(And a good job in school today)

(Tell him I’d beat his ass in a race)

(Cuzzzz soooo much coffee)

(Aww baby)

(Hehe idk he's kinda tall
Don't worry boy
He's 3/4 Asian
I only like half)

(I'm getting food so give me like 2 min)

(Okay girl)

(Oh my god food is so good Ryan)

(Oh baby)

(I’m glad you’re happy
And apparently psyched on coffee
Hey hey anyways
I was looking through our old conversations, because when you switched phone numbers again, all the text chains split to their respective ones
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
I’m using some of your data up
Or WiFi)

(Yes yes)

(Cause you’re cute)

(And I miss you
And all these conversations were so innocent and cute
And now I just feel like I breakdown constantly)

(Awww boyyy)

(And we over sexualize to compensate for something that used to be so accessible)

(Yeahhhh)

(Yeah I know)

(And it just makes me constantly horny and I satisfied
Un)

(Fuck
College has already changed us, in 45 days)

(Shhh shhh)

(Mollie remember when we first added each other on Snapchat? And every time we got a selfie, we flipped out. And we’d have long conversations over snap, just to keep seeing each other’s faces)

(Just for now)

(We do the best we can)

(Ugh)

(Aww boy)

(I know girl)

(Of course)

(See now all of our conversations are this)

(Did you read some of screenshots?)

(I remember when I just tried to make every text funny and clever so you would keep talking to me)

(They’re so cute 🙄)

(Boyyy)

(Hehe
Mollie read them
Like seriously look back)

(Aw baby)

(Hahaha no it’s okay)

(Gosh that's so weird
Ok ok
I'll add some more excitement and surprise 
I can do that)

(It’s just something I’ve realized
We’re not as innocent and naive anymore
Definitely different people haha
Grew up a little I guess
Anyways Mollie)

(I'm yes)

(Good girl)

(I am an adult
And you are 19)

(I know)

(Huh is when boys turn into adults)

(But frick)

(*which
Cuz ya know)

(Girls are ahead of the curve)

(Uh what?)

(🙄)

(Hahaha)

(Right right
Sure
In kitchen cleaning
Okay girl
I’m gonna make a deal with you)

(YOUUUU)

(Ready?)

(Like I ever did my chores)

(Don’t worry you’re just ahead)

(I’ll catch up
Mollie seriously
Ugh this might suck
Mollie let’s put on a pause on texting for 3 days
Starting at noon
72 hours baby
Only communication is via voice calls at the end of the day
Or morning
Or whatever time works for our weird schedule)

(Wait)

(Idk)

(What about memes
The memes Ryan)

(I think this would be productive
Which sucks
Because we have to lose the streak)

(Ryan)

(What)

(Awwwwwww
Pfffttttt
Pft)

(Are you all right with trying this?
I mean I love texting you *constantly*
But I’ve read taking break strengthens relationships a bit
When you’re only allowed to use voice to communicate
The version I read was one week. But idk if we’re capable of that 🙄
Oh Mollie where’d you go?
Oh yeah your letters just showed up
Idk if we’re starting early or not, but okayyy
Well Mollie, idk if this is some cruel joke or not but okay. Just let me know what you think)

(No no nooooo)

(Oh phew)

(I just
I was given a hot chocolate soufle
I'm sorry
My attention was pulled away
And for some reason I just don't feel these)

(Sorry)

(What)

(Eating fudge makes me fudge up
Hehe

That sounds good)

(Yeah)

(Heyyyyy Mollie)

(Not great
Turns out knowing I can't talk to you doesn't help my anxiety 
Jesus)

(Hey baby heyyyy)

(Two things)

(Does paleo allow dairy?)

(Not cow)

(That makes no sense)

(But goat and sheep)

(But I have very small amounts in some of my other food)

(Oh)

(It's about the protein to sugar ratio)

(Makes sense)

(And we started consuming cow dairy way more recently)

(Oh)

(It's the lactose that people react too)

(Cow has way more than anything else)

(Is that only in cow dairy?)

(Other Ones have it just way less)

(Mmphf cool)

(The other milks are like "old milk" that people are better adapted to
Cow milk is still kinda recent I think evolutionarily)

(What's the other thing?)

(I wanna try goat milk)

(It's)

(Huh)

(Idk
Stronger
Like
Ya know goat cheese is kinda pungent?
Kinda like that I guess)

(I don’t think I’ve ever had goat cheese either)

(Wait)

(Oh maybe then)

(Really?
I never gave you any?
Huh
I love it it's like my favorite)

(I feel like I would’ve known jags)

(Yeahhh)

(Haha)

(I think we got that cheddar instead)

(*hahahaa)

(Mmm wine and cheese night)

(I’m gonna remember that forever)

(What a good trip)

Don’t ever vape nicotine again please
Like seriously
Like weed’s harmless ish
But this kid in front of me is frickin addicted to nicotine and now he’s going to church every Sunday to pray to stop
Agh
It sucks
He came into the room talking about how he’s gonna stop, and now he’s just vaping and talking to us
Like please don’t try that anymore)

(Awww Jesus)

(Yayy)

(Don't worry I left that home
I think I'm kinda done inhaling things
It's not that great)

(As long as it’s not nicotine
Just avoid that stuff)

(Yeah)

(Aw)

(I'm kinda digging our no substances rn 
Unless we really gonna go hard it doesn't really pay off
Did I send you "sorry" by moth and flame
Also haha
I forgot to tell you that you were complemented by some Chinese kids earlier 
Mainly Michelle
They all think I have good taste in a complementary partner 
Haha
They praised you and my ability to find a good partner for a balanced duo or soemthing like that 😂
They crack me up)

(Hehe
Dynamic duo)

(Haha yeah I think that's what they meant)

(Mollie I’m so frickin sleepy)

(They're so funny
Most of the time I don't know what they're saying but they're pretty cute)

(But I need to finish calc
Goodnight girl)

(Aw)

(Hey)

(Nighty night boy)

(Mollie
Cmon)

(Hey)

(Cmonnnnn)

(What)

(You wanna step outside and call?)

(Everything okay?)

(I don't know)

(Can we just do a call?)

(I just
I took more medication)

(What’s wrong)

(I don't know what to do)

(Aw baby)

(What’s up)

(Ryan it's not just stress dreams anymore)

(What’s bothering you girl)

(Like)

(Aw
Hey)

(It's real nightmares)

(Aw baby)

(Like horror film
I am in actual danger
Waking up sweaty and crying 
And panting nightmares
I can't go back to sleep
I'm afraid to even get off my bed even though I know that's dumb
I hate this)

(All weekend I just missed you so much)

(Ssh)

(Now I can't even sleep when I want to
I'm so tired Ryan 
I just want to cry
Goddammit 
Stupid roommates
Actually
If provably be a lot worse if I knew she wasn't here
I miss you
I miss having you hold me while I sleep
I didn't have the nightmares then
Ugh I'm sorry
Maybe I'll just smoke soemthing and skip all my classes tomorrow)

(And just take my stupid test)

(Mollie)

(Hey girl)

(No weed might make it worse)

(I think we both know the first like ten days are the worst)

(While we get used to being alone again
We kinda cheated last time)

(Well now I am crying)

(Cause I went to Boston right away)

(Fuck)

(Aw baby
Hey look
When was the last time you smoked? And how many times did you do ITV
It?)

(Once)

(I know we talked about how it might trigger anxiety)

(Like three nights ago)

(If you use it as a crutch, it’s gonna trigger some bad stuff)

(I couldn't sleep)

(Aw baby)

(But it didn't do anything but make me hungry)

(Haha)

(I know)

(Aw baby)

(I didn't want to tell you)

(Just it’s something to do if you’re already feeling happy hahha)

(And with other people)

(I wasn't sad really)

(Mmphf)

(Just)

(Wanting slee)

(Okay then don’t worry about it)

(Sleep)

(Maybe I was stressed I don't know)

(Is it just your meds?)

(Ryan)

(Like you didn’t take them on time or enough or something?)

(I don't know)

(My meds are a constant part of me)

(Aw baby)

(Im hoping so
According to NAMI you can get bad nightmares if you accidentally miss a dose
But I already have the stupid vivid dreaming
It's like some sick joke after having the maladaptive daydreaming for so long)

(Like life is getting me back for all the good dreams I had during the daytime)

(Aw baby)

(And hijacking my nights)

(Mollie)

(This used to happen when I was really little)

(Agh)

(We just have to make it like one month
And a week
Then we get a wholeeee week and a half)

(I'd wake up all sweaty and scared and cry until my papa came)

(Then one month)

(Fuck I know)

(Then a whole threewww months)

(Ryan)

(Shhhh)

(Yeah girl)

(Four
Ryan)

(Four for you haha)

(I almost broke up with you this weekend)

(So that’s four for us I guess)

(Mmphf
Really?)

(Yeah)

(Well that’d be silly)

(Twice)

(How though?)

(I don't know what exactly the reason was)

(Agh)

(But it was after he initial panic attacks)

(Right when I’m getting all on track)

(And I was crying and scared)

(And being good and safe and responsible)

(And I wanted you so bad)

(But I just wanted the pain to go away)

(Aw baby)

(Sssh
Scared of what?)

(And I know you're not causing it per say)

(Hmm)

(Yeah I know the feeling)

(But you always make it better)

(I got it all weekend too)

(And that scared me too)

(I just couldn’t get my mind off you
Eh)

(Not being able to have you and knowing it ryab)

(But that’s a good sign right)

(Hehe)

(I guess)

(At least we both like each other that much)

(But then I started panicking)

(We’re crazyyyh)

(Because I obviously can't handle losing you)

(Sssh)

(Ugh)

(Yeah me too girl)

(It was just scary because)

(Just do well in school and stay in shape girl)

(That’s all you gotta do)

(For the first I guess I saw how much I'd grown into you)

(That keeps me happy)

(And I’m never gonna leave your side)

(Like)

(Yeah girl I know)

(I'm dependent whether I want to be or not)

(You’re my other half
I identify so much with you)

(I honestly don't know what I would do if you broke up with me Ryan)

(So much of me is based on you haha)

(Like)

(Yeah me too)

(I would want to be dead)

(I know girl)

(No pressure)

(Hehe)

(Sure girl
I’ve got this)

(Sorry)

(Yeah once I slowed down the drinking, everything pretty much got better for me)

(I don't know why I chose now to tell you all this)

(So try your best girl)

(I didn't even do it)

(I think we’re both in the same boat haha)

(Crap)

(I just need to stick with the meds)

(We realllyyy like that stuff)

(Yeah)

(Almost too much)

(I don't think they interact well together)

(No I don’t think so girl)

(Even your doctor said that)

(It literally says not to do it on the bottle)

(Did you end up buying anything else?)

(And the website)

(And the doctor said no)

(Like at target)

(Hm?
No more booze)

(I only have my wine now)

(Oh haha)

(Mmphf
The last bottle)

(I have away all the other stuff)

(All)

(Besides a cider I drank all sad the other night)

(Aw
Aw baby)

(Yeah)

(Sssh)

(I was kinda thinking about you then too
Did not make me feel better)

(No surprise)

(Mollie)

(Jesus Christ
It’s gonna be okay)

(I know)

(I don’t know why you’d think I’d wanna leave you)

(I know that just)

(You’re the cutest girl in the world)

(And I love you so much
Agh
I love your personality
And how you keep me motivated
And you’re the outgoing one
And introduce me to all these great people)

(Aw boy)

(And I get to be my introverted self)

(And not worry about the negatives
Cause I got you
I always have someone to vent to)

(Maybe it's just scary to see a life that I never imagined for myself)

(I always have someone to call mine)

(You’re that for me girl)

(Sometimes it's just scary to commit)

(I love you)

(Aw boy)

(Hehe)

(I love you too
I'm crying as i send that dammit
I love you so much)

(Aw baby)

(It's just so scary to commit to that future when it's so different from what I always imagined dammit)

(Aw)

(Sssh)

(This is why people can't have expectations)

(What did you imagine in the first place? 😂)

(I don't know)

(I’m pretty happy with what I’ve got)

(I am too)

(I’m pretty happy I’ve gotten to nail you)

(Definitely
So much happier)

(Hehe)

(As many times as I have...)

(Hey now)

(Hehe)

(Mmpf)

(Haha)

(Idk I guess I thought I'd do more bad things in college)

(Like what?)

(Like go through that weird experimental phase and all that)

(Like sleeping around and stuff?)

(I mean we have done bad things)

(Yeah I know girl haha)

(Just as a dynamic duo)

(It’s probably better this way)

(Yeahhhh
Kinda)

(For your sake at least
And easier
Oh god
So much easier)

(Honestly I think I am happier)

(The amount of emotional weight that we don’t have to deal with)

(Like)

(I'm so happy to be with you dammit)

(Of whether or not the person we slept with cares about us)

(I know I know
It's just a weird feeling)

(Or loves us
Or wanting them and knowing that they might’ve used you
Agh)

(And not having someone always physically here to reinforce freaks me out when I'm feeling weak I guess)

(That would be nerve racking)

(Jesus)

(Haha yeah girl)

(Shhhh
I know
I'm not emotionally equipped to handle that
We're both too sweet and we know it)

(Hehe
Mm hmm)

(Hey boy)

(And the best part is)

(I'm gonna look for some co ops in la)

(I’m getting laid wayyyy more than any of these kids sleeping around every weekend)

(Like right now)

(Hehehe)

(And I get to have sex without the aid of a party or booze)

(Yeah boy
Mmpf)

(It’s the best)

(Gonna fuck you up)

(Like when you visit)

(Like)

(We’re gonna have 9 straight days of sex)

(Hehe
Multiple times
A day)

(Some people ryan can't even get it once a day)

(Oh my god)

(We literally do it at least twice a day)

(Mollie
La co op)

(And silly a couple rounds each time)

(You’re right)

(*usually)

(That would be absolutely amazing)

(Yeah yeah)

(And they would give you housing
I could just live with you)

(I know)

(Mm hmm)

(That would be the dream
And if there isn't a good one now I can technically make one
If I'm creative and pushy enough
Mmpf)

(Yeah girl
I trust you)

(Yeah boy)

(Mm hmm)

(God that would be so great 
Okay baby)

(I feel a lot better)

(Aw)

(Not gonna sleep yet but)

(Good talk)

(You can)

(Yayy)

(Sorry for pulling you from whatever I did)

(I gotta wake up at 7)

(Agh)

(We're you sleeping?)

(And I was about to)

(I'm sorry)

(I was getting breakfast ready for the morning)

(You’ve helped me on multipleeeeee occasions)

(Yeah)

(We both know that)

(I'm sorry if I was ever a little insensitive)

(When you’re down, I’ll help you up)

(Now that I've had the real breakdown)

(And when I’m down, I’m gonna depend on you to help me up)

(It's really shitty)

(Yeah baby)

(Aww)

(I'll always be here
Ugh)

(I love being a duo)

(Yeah girl)

(We're lucky baby)

(We’re gonna fucking nail this thing so hard)

(So lucky)

(Mmpf)

(So much opportunity)

(We’re very lucky)

(Now I'm feeling happy)

(I’m not gonna trash it)

(Me neither boy)

(Mmphf)

(Okay baby

You can go to sleep)

(I'm gonna look at co ops)

And really hurt
And I’m upset
 I’m not happy
I’m so sad

You don’t make me happy anymore
I don’t want it to be like that)

(Oh jesus Ryan)

(I don’t care Mollie)

(Baby I'm here
I'm kicking them out right now
Ryan
I haven't talked deep with anyone cmon
It's just you
Deep here isn't the same as deep with you you know that 
Don't you?)

(You can talk deep with whoever you want
I really don’t care
But just don’t make that such an important component
It’s annoyingly
Annoying)

(Dammit boy)

(I wasn’t fine Mollie)

(What is it
What happened?
You were fine)

(I ran home to be with you and you didn't seem to care)

(Mollie)

(agh
I don’t)

(Goddammit what is it)

(I dot know what it is)

(I don’t know
Mollie)

(Is it just a down?)

(Idk)

(Normally uou maken me happy
When I see you)

(Boy let me call)

(But it doesn’t work anymore)

(And okay
Play)

(Or watch soemthing)

(I have to gonpee first)

(Ryan cmon)

(Idk
Mollie
You don’t make me happy)

(You barely even pay attention even more and I just get sad)

(Idk why)

(Dammit Ryan)

(I wish you would do something good)

(Goddammit)

(Please
Like an ambition idk
LAtely
It seems like all you do is “make connections” that lead to nowhere)

(Dammit boy)

(Except parting)

(Stop)

(N ono no)

(Ryan we're different people goddammit)

(Too much stress on connections)

(I've been trying to tell you but I don't know how)

(We get places differently)

(Connections do jack shit unless you also have something to offer)

(And I always feel like you're trying to one up me and it makes me so mad)

(And talking deep is lame)

(Dammit Ryan)

(That’s nothing)

(Shut up that is nothing)

(I just want someone with more drive)

(Why are you so stuck on that nk)

(I’m going pee)

(Dammit Ryan
I'm driven
But I'm on a different path
Ryan you're free
That's what scares me
I know that you ass
Don't you think I don't know that
But you're skill set is different
It's nothing j really have control over
Goddammit Ryan
Who else is there then?
Jesus Christ at least respond to me
Ryan
I've been in such a down
You didn't can ben notice

Goddammit
Nevermind)

(Mollie idk
Idk)

(You want this to be over?)

(Sorry I guess I noticed a bit)

(Is that what you're honestly telling me now?)

(Sssh)

(Mollie I’m sorry
I don’t know Jamie to fix this)

(How much have you had to drink?)

(How to)

(Ryan)

(Mollie I know)

(Just talk to me dammit
You never just talk to me
I always leave my stuff to talk o you and be with you
But you never seem like you care
Talk to me boy)

(That’s the problem
Idk
Idk anymore)

(You don't know what?)

(Why I don’t vv want to)

(Dammit Ryan)

(Yeah and I feel shitty too)

(It's your idea
And ou want to meet at a certain time
And I cancel other stuff to make it happen 
And I know
I know you don't want to
And then I just feel shitty)

(Then don't ask me)

(Then I feel guilty)

(Ryan)

(How do you freln abouttenme?)

(Don't ask me then
Don't try to force it
I think this was literally one of our first talks together
Sometimes letting something be is fine)

(Feel)

(Honeslty)

(Be honest)

(Please)

(I was always against long distance relationships)

(Okay)

(Always
But you changed my mind)

(And)

(Because I realized that if it was the right person it didn't really matter)

(Oh girl)

(I guess I just realized)

(I’m sorry)

(That sometimes you have to risk it all on an investment
For the possible gains
You've honestly been worth it to me
You're someone to pull me back down to earth everyday
And someone to hold me accountable for my actions 
And I love you
I honestly do 
My life is so different now than I ever planned for it to be
But I'm okay with that because you seem worth it to me
But if I'm going to be stuck here loving you
And you not loving me 
I honestly don't know what I'll do ryan
I'm my own person and I know that
And I'm proud of who I am
But I like to be my own person and not be alone
I don't know Ryan
What spurred this on
Last night I tried to go party but I came home
I always come home
Because you always text
And I always feel sad
Goddammit where are you)

(You can go party)

(Ryan)

(I won’t text again)

(Just)

(You’re you)

(You’ll be good)

(You realize you spent our whole first term doing that right?)

(You’re good)

(I am good
I bring people home
I get drunk
And even shutfaced)

(I leave early because I only want you)

(Idk)

(I'm so good
And I want to hear from you
And I put that first
But what is this
What are you doing ryan?)

(Idk mollie)

(Are you jealous of Connor?)

(No haha)

(Cmon boy
Talk to me)

(I think he’s an asshole)

(It's just me then)

(If you honestly want that)

(Maybe)

(Take him)

(What)

(He laughed about taking a girls virginity)

(Jesus no
We're friends but that's it god
Ryan I already went through all that dammit)

(I'm not interested)

(Okay okayi)

(Ryan
I'm not defending him)

(Ignore him)

(I really don't know)

(I don’t care)

(Sssh
He’s not even on my mind
I just hate it)

(Then talk to me dammit)

(When you literally had two people there)

(And made me sit there)

(Ryan)

(And watch you socialize)

(Dammit)

(Like I have better things to do)

(You leave all the time)

(Yeah I leave)

(I do too)

(But I make time)

(But I don’t just try to do both)

(I thought they would go)

(I was trying to)

(Ok)

(Dammit I'm sorry
If that's what's bothering you I'm sorry
Shit
I know that was shitty of me
I don't know why I always forget that Ryan 
I wasn't trying to hurt you
I always forget you're not there too)

(Everything’s good now)

(Really?)

(Mollie)

(Cuz you were saying a lot of other hurtful stuff Ryan)

(And you haven't really talked to me all day)

(Godmit)

(Gmoleli
Mollir
I want it to be true
But I do not feel good)

(Jesus how much did you drink)

(Yeah and I’m skipping my assignment)

(I don't either
But I know I'd feel worse without you
Ryan baby
Is it just a down?)

(I’ll turn it in late
I don’t know
Don’t worry
It’s just 1% for the first day
Alll okay
Mollie)

(Ryan)

(I don’t know)

(I'm sorry I had you drink with me)

(I know it’s really really hurtful)

(You were doing really well)

(But I’m trying to be honest)

(Um)

(Dammit I know)

(Normally I get really happy and excited to see you)

(Like a puppy seeing their owner
Idk
I just feel all good and happy
And that hasn’t happened in a bit
Idk why)

(How long is a boy?)

(I don’t want it to be that)

(Way)

(Bit)

(Like a week or so)

(I don't either boy)

(Wait do you feel it too?)

(I've been a bit down this week)

(Yeah I’d)

(But I have downs too sometimes 
No I just feel like you don't really care about me lately
And it makes everything else a lot worse
Idk)

(The OCD has been really bad lately and it's hard to focus on anything else)

(Normally I want to write you a shit ton of letters)

(And I’ve only sent like one)

(I know)

(I haven’t even got anything from you)

(I got it
I was really happy)

(Not even a letter)

(Really?)

(And it’s literally 49 cents)

(Not yet?)

(There's like five in my package)

(Like Jesus Christ)

(It hasn't arrived yet?)

(No it didn’t)

(Shit)

(That’s not your fault I guess)

(Why)

(Okay Mollie that’s fine)

(Ugh Ryan
I'm sorry
I just write in packs I don't know why
I got so used to greece it feels like a waste to not send them like that
I guess I can try to break them up more)

(I don’t mind
It’s okay
I’m sorry
I just want to be happy with you again
I don’t want to be like this)

(With me)

(But I really don’t feel good about us)

(Or with me?)

(Aren’t those the same?)

(Like us together
Or haply about me
And being with me as a thing)

(No)

(Sssh)

(I like you)

(One is ownership)

(You’re a good person)

(One is shared)

(Maybe we should call?)

(Yeah boy)

(I’m not gonna break up with you or anything)

(But I might cry fair warning)

(I just want to fix some stuff
Idk why
I really don’t know why)

(Then we need to talk)

(I feel shorty)

(Shitty
And guilty)

(That's what I've been saying)

(Because I want to really really like you again)

(Me too
Why guilty?)

(I wanna light up every time I see your face or Amherst your voice
Hear)

(Aw boy)

(Yeah)

(I want that too
Do you want to call?
Ryan?)

(Go ahead
One arc)

(Call when you're ready)

(Okkkkkkayyyy)

(What was that For?
Cmonnnn)

(The conversation was over)

(Aw baby)

(Hey)

(Don't)

(Cmon call back)

(Ryan
I don't know what the hell you think I do
But it's not like I just sit around on my ass
We live in different worlds
But I bend over backwards all the fucking time to make them meet so I can spend time with you)

(No)

(I’m sorry)

(I'm done)

(Ryan)

(I know you do)

(It doesn't matter)

(Okay so now what?)

(Hey)

(You just never change the way you think)

(Okay)

(Well can you tell that to me
Over voice
I just a little help
Cmon)

(So I can listen to you program while you only give half your attention to me?)

(Okay I’m sorry)

(I’ll put that way
I just like distraction)

(Ryan)

(I’m sorry)

(I guess you do that to me too)

(I don't want you to like being distracted from me)

(And I get angry)

(I know)

(I know)

(And it feels like shit)

(Agh)

(Okay
Sssh)

(But you do it)

(Yeah it’s not people)

(Literally every time)

(And I just know you don't care)

(But I see how that hurts)

(Okay)

(You don't care enough to listen to me)

(Hey girl I’m going to bed now. My alarm’s set for 10:30am, just wanted to let you know that I’m not ignoring you)

(I don't matter 
Not in the same way
Because I'm a girl to you
It hurts so much 
I move everything aside and I only get maybe half of your attention)

(I’m sorry for today
Anyways, I love you and I hope you have a good morning

Sorry for being so shitty sometimes. I feel terrible and mean and hurtful)

(That might be a good idea
The melatonin is probably still active)

(Are you feeling okay?

It sucks but it's not really your fault 
I mean
You didn't go about it in the best of ways 
But I just kind of chalked that up to ignorance

(I know boy)

(Sssh)

(It's okay)

(I like you)

How lucky I got)

(I’m so happy to be with you)

(Me too boy)

(I’m so happy I’m yours)

(And you’re mine)

(It's okay when this happens sometimes)

(So happy)

Never again)

(Mmm
 Hey hey
Mollie
How does the whole promise ring thing work!)

(Hm?)

(?)

(Question mark)

(I mean)

(Do I have to wear one too?)

(Kind of an engagement ring
But you choose what you're promising to
Like
You make the rules
And it's symbolic)

(Well)

(That’s tooo girli)

(Yeah
But I mean
It all depends)

(E)

(Well)

(Can we choose something cooler)

(Like a sweet bracelet)

(That's why some people do tattoos or a necklace or soemthing)

(Yeah honestly)

(Right
Well
I wasn't going to tell you this)

(But)

(A tatto)

(That would make me never forget)

(I kinda was making one 🙄)

(Never forgettttt)

(What?)

(The thing I was making you)

(Aww)

(It was that
Didn't think you'd ever think of that 🙄)

(A bracelet?
Or a ring?)

(Well a ring)

(Mollieeee)

(Agh)

(But I wa a probbaly gonna put it on a bracelet or necklace)

(But then it looks like I’m married)

(And that’s weird)

(I knew you wouldn't wear a ring)

(Yeah)

(I know)

(A necklace is good)

(I would wear that)

(It wasn't for your finger cuz idk how big it is)

(Then I could tuck it under my shirt)

(Heyyy)

(I was just gonna put it on like a chain)

(And I could touch it whenever I want)

(Yeah)

(So you could hide it)

(Let’s do that)

(Wait)

(Aww)

(So you want your ring?)

(On a necklace)

(Keep making it?)

(Yeah)

(Well yeah)

(Not for my finger)

(Dammit)

(Stupid girllll)

(I wanted to surprise you
Why do you ruin all my surprises 🙄
Stupid boy)

(Hahahahaha)

(Ugh)

(Whattt)

(Okay
I guess you still get it
But I'm not telling you when
Also if you want me to have one
That's up to you)

(Mollie
But they’re supposed to be matching)

(They don't have to be)

(Why can’t you just make two of the same?)

(Then they march
Match)

(Plus it's hard to make 🙄)

(But I want them to be)

(Nope)

(Aw baby)

(I was making yours)

(Cmon)

(So I could propose a promise to you)

(Aw dammitthat)

(And it was just going to be for you
But if you want two
That's up to you)

(That’s so much work
Aghhh
Mollie)

(Yes I know)

(Why can’t we work together)

(A promise is a lot f work)

(I’ll team up with you)

(We can make two of the same)

(Hmmmm)

(That would be nice)

(I'll think about it
Maybe I'll make the base
And you can add the chain and any designs you want
I could concede to that maybe)

(Mmm)

(Yeah girl)

(Well maybe I can work fast and get them done
And leave them with you)

(Less then a month
Oohhhhh nooo
Your patriots
It’s not looking good
It was all tied up)

(Woah really?)

(You guys were just at 33 vs 32)

(Woah
There might be riots
Damn)

(And now it’s 33 vs 38
Nottt t good)

(Woahhh)

(2 min)

(How much time left?)

(2:03

(I can make one)

(Mmm)

(Okay

Somehow

(And I’ll check Daley’s)

(Agh that’s far

(Yeah haha)

(I miss ice cream)

(It looks so good)

(I'm almost tempted 😂)

(There’s a bucket of cream cheese next to me)

(And I want to devour it
Hey hey
Switch up your diet
Just go vegan with me
Then we’ll be the same)

(Vegan?)

(Okay)

(Ugh I just got fish tho
Mmpf
I'm pretty close I guess though
Hmmm)

(Depends on food costs I guess)

(I’ll let you be peskatarian)

(Vegan plus fish)

(But I did cut most dairy and all red meat)

(20 seconds left)

(Hahaha
If I find a good coconut or almond creamer
Then I'll be all the way)

(Shooootttt)

(Hokyyyy shit)

(Maybe that's why there's all the police
Hmmm)

(It was sooo close
If the patriots caught it
God damn
Right in the end zone)

(Wait what?)

(Holy shot)

(Mollie
It was *this* close to a tie
It was 41 33
They almost got the touchdown
Which is 6 points
Then they would’ve got a kickoff for two points
So 42 v 41
*41 41
You guys were soooo close)

(Woahhh)

(Aw what)

(Shit
There's so many cops)

(That’s so cool)

(Hahaha)

(Yeah okay I’m back)

(It’s pretty good)

(Cuz I keep reading about them and they're pretty cheap)

(Mmm)

(So I just added a shit ton to my oats
Haha)

(Delish)

(Apparently they're good for pulling out heavy metals)

(Mm)

(Oh and so is cilantro
But the gel plants
Like aloe and chia seeds
The lipid-Phyllic toxins I was talking about earlier can bong to the gel

(I scram)

(Haha)

(Hmm?)

(Okay)

(Breast milk)

(Yeah but how)

(Apparently it's actually been a huge midterm for years)

(Midterm?)

(Because the third main component of it was indigestible to humans
They found out it was to feed the special bacteria that are supposed to live in our guys)

(Guts)

(We)

(And those bacteria are what kill germs and bad bacteria
Isn't that weird?
And then they found a bunch of stuff
That wasn't to feed the kid
But the other stuff that was livin inside it
So weird
And no 
I just wound up here lookin at food stuff
Because it's like "the perfect food")

(Eww)

(Okay)

(Sorry for needing out)

(And idk what you meant)

(Nerding)

(Mystery)

(Not exactly?
Sorry)

(I didn't think so)

(But I still would really like to do that)

(Aw hey)

(I probably shouldn't have said anything)

(Well I want something)

(Sssh)

(I get that)

(I just want something where I can look down and remember you)

(My hearts just not that in it right now)

(Like a tattoo)

(And I wanted to be sure)

(Or a bracelet)

(I know boy)

(Aww)

(That was the idea)

(Sorry)

(Aw baby
I’ve been an asshole
Sorry I guess I deserve that)

(Kind of)

(Most definitely)

(But you do want it?)

(Well)

(Aw baby)

(Alright then
I'll make yours I guess)

(Don’t do it if your heart isn’t in it
No one wants that
I don’t mind)

(No)

(God dammit)

(I was really excited about it
Though I did want it to be a surprise
I'll do it
I just wanted to make sure I wasn't spending all this time and everything to have you toss it)

(Mollie
I’ve treasured every single gift you’ve given me
I ride your skateboard every single day
And I love showing it off to people
And looking down and reminiscing on all the stupid stuff we say to each other
So don’t go ahead and think I’m going to toss it)

(Okay boy)

(Mm Kesha)

(I'm glad you like it
Praying - kesha
Wolves - dreamers)

(I’ll listen after my lab)

(Police encounters - ffs)

(Is that franz ferdinand and sparks?)

(Ok)

(Mmm)

(Mm)

(I think so
They have a bunch of stuff)

(I’m out now)

(I'm running)

(Mm)

(Good girl
Mollie
Heyyyyyy)

(Hm?)

(I feel like shit and I’m sad and depressed)

(So good job on that
Anyways
Your package finally arrived)

(Join the club)

(Are we gonna do anything about this?)

(Good
About time)

(I've been waiting for you)

(You’re kinda draining the life out of me)

(I've just been running a shit ton and not eating)

(I’m trying to cheer you up)

(I get that Ryan)

(Jesus Christ girl)

(I'm just scared right now
I got hurt
I realize I've always been takin that risk
It just freaked me out
I feel like you don't know me and I'm scared
That's all
I'm sorry)

(Mollie)

(I'm trying to be better but it's really hard)

(I know you so well)

(I was already having an off week)

(Agh)

(And I was really looking forward to just talking to you)

(It’s alright)

(Agh idk
I know I know
I ruined it)

(And you kinda gutshot me)

(I got annoyed and lashed out)

(That’s me)

(I know)

(I’m sorry)

(I know it is)

(I deserve it)

(It's okay)

(But honestly)

(I just wasn't exactly ready for that)

(I really want to fix this)

(I’m tired of being sad)

(I do too boy)

(I’m tired of you being sad)

(Me too
I feel awful
Just all day)

(I keep crying)

(Which part Mollie)

(Me too)

(Which part was it)

(Honestly Ryan)

(Yeah idk why I did that)

(You just sort of come off as always being better than the people around
Which I kinda knew 
But I never thought you'd directly turn it on me like that
And I just wasn't ready
I hold you in such high regard that like
You kinda destroyed me)

(Maybe it was all just pent up
I’ll)

(You were jealous and kind of drunk)

(I’d)

(And idk what else)

(Djjejjds)

(Frick
Yeah
That would do the trick)

(Yeah)

(Sorry idk)

(It's kinda happened before I guess)

(Yeah I know)

(This time was just really bad)

(And I'd already let my guard down)

(This time it was about you)

(So I got hurt)

(The other times they weren’t really)

(No you'd just lash out at me)

(What?)

(Just
Do you really think that?
Can I ever be a real person to you?)

(What do you mean?)

(Do you even remember what you said)

(Yeah I do)

(But I don’t remember dehumanizing you
You’re a real person)

(But you dehumanize girls)

(No of course not)

(At least you used to
But what you said
It came from somewhere
Do you really think that?)

(I already told you that
That was a long time ago
It just sucks
Also
It’s just a residual insecurity
That wasn’t what last two nights ago was about
I don’t even think about that)

(About what?)

(I know)

(Me not being good enough?
Ugh
I know it's an insecurity
I've always known it's there
I knew that when I agreed to date you
It's okay boy
It was just really sucky and really shitty timing)

(I never said you weren’t good enough)

(And I was already down)

(I just was getting annoyed that’s all)

(I mean
You kinda did
Plus I get insecure too)

(Yeah)

(I never told you when I had a pet peeve)

(Then you said a bunch of shit about me)

(I just kept it to myself
I didn’t want to hurt you)

(I guess I never did either)

(And then I said all of them at once)

(Well)

(Mm hmm)

(I guess this is what we get)

(But boy)

(Mollie but I want you too)

(I am doing stuff
I just don't tell you everything cuz
Well I guess I like having a part of my life to myself)

(Agh)

(That's just for me)

(Wtf)

(Agh)

(I don’t think you can say that in a relationship)

(Okay
Nevermind
That's just
A dumb thing left over from childhood)

(Sorry)

(That’s awfully mean)

(No no not about you)

(I know)

(Just like
Some of the things I do
Or dream about
Idk)

(That’s what I’m talking about
You’re supposed to share everything)

(Crap)

(Your gains are my gains)

(Okay)

(Your losses are mine too)

(Shit)

(I thought that was a given)

(I know boy
Ugh
I'm kinda glad to hear you say that
Sorry that's just a weird thing left over from when I was little
Idk
I got teased about some thins that kinda)

(Maybe stuck with me)

(Agh okay)

(Yeah but)

(No worries)

(Don’t worry about it)

(It feels good to hear you say it out loud)

(That’s why I share when I’m excited about a project)

(But I'll tell you know
Now
Shit 🙄)

(Or a potential job)

(Aw)

(Because we get to share it and have fun with the product)

(Dammit)

(You are a good boy)

(I wanna make money so I can take you places)

(Aw baby)

(Yeah idk)

(I'm sorry)

(I just got a little pissed off when you kept mentioning connections
I just wanted you to do something
And you are
I saw your suit 🙄)

(I was getting pissed off when you kept talking about your school)

(Last week I was getting like 4 hours of sleep a day)

(That was dumb)

(And trying so hard to make it work)

(But I knew you didn't like mine)

(Aw haha
Don’t worry about it)

(And it made me feel like you didn't like me)

(It’s not your school haha)

(And I was getting so frustrated)

(Aw baby)

(I just wanted to spite you a little)

(I think it’s just me getting brainwashed by the UC system)

(Which is stupid
It hurts us both)

(Which is very for public education)

(But I hate feeling like someone's patronizing me)

(And anti usc)

(Yeah)

(So I just see negatives)

(You did kinda end up in the poster board backwards school 🙄)

(And there’s a bit of pride when we beat them in sports)

(Agh I know boy)

(Like we beat them with half of the budget)

(Just
I'm not there)

(Haha

(Ryan)

(We already decided against one upping each other in school haha)

(Sports is different 🙄)

(Hmmpf)

(Like honestly it's alright if you didn't do anything)

(Maybe I should do more of that now)

(Not gonna lie
The learning curve is really high
It's easy for a while)

(I am very aware 🙄)

(Then it hits you)

(Yeah)

(And it makes no sense what you're typing)

(It's easy to learn what everything is haha)

(But you just type it because it tells you to)

(But making stuff takes time)

(Then you don't learn anything)

(Yeahhh
Honestly)

(Hahaha)

(Hmm)

(I could teach you
Hmmm)

(Really?)

(Mollie)

(Like I'm pretty good a teaching it)

(Do you have any evidence to back that up 🙄)

(Yeah I taught kids tons of stuff at Del oto)

(Not that I doubt you)

(Frick
Pro)

(Really?)

(Autocorrect is stupid now)

(Hahaha)

(Yeah Mollie
That was what I did every Friday senior year
I taught kids how to program stuff)

(In makers club?)

(And actually build stuff)

(Awwww)

(Instead of all that's academic bullshit)

(I almost went to that)

(That's all theory and doesn't really teach you)

(I really wanted to)

(Haha)

(I think online courses are bs)

(But my friend who said they'd go with me wouldn't do it)

(Aw you should've)

(Then I was rowing)

(Maybe not)

(I probably would've spent the whole time on you)

(Hahaha)

(That wouldn't have been fair)

(You say that)

(Oooh yeah)

(🙄 I'm sure t would've just been me pining though)

(And you mr noticing hahaha)

(Probably would've been fine)

(Not)

(It's okay)

(I'll be Mr Noticing)

(Now maybe)

(Aw)

Ugh
It's never going to stop being funny to me how hard I was gaming for you
Literally even your friendship
I just wanted a small place in your life
Agh)

(Aww baby
It's okay
I'll just never let it go
Also
I didn't know
So you should've tried harder)

(I knowwwwww)

(Uhhh)

(But once I thought you hated me 
I was afraid to even broach it 
So I just tried really hard to be your friend without directly asking o be your friend
I literally
I just wanted you to think of and think of me fondly
Or at least
Not disliking me
Which probably isn't good for me
Haha
But yet was like)

(All consuming)

(Hmm)

(I don't remember the forced friendship thing
And yeah idk)

(That's when I conveniently would be around you haha)

(I'm really glad we kinda skipped friends)

(That was fun)

(It kinda was)

(Aww haha)

(It was kinda fun to jump into it haha all scared but like)

(Like I think it's much harder as friends)

(With the same priorities)

(Because there's no excitement)

(Yeah cuz then you don't know how to move on someone)

(Idk)

(Yeah)

(If you've got everything already figured out)

(You're already comfortable
Mmpf boy)

(And there's no guessing and learning)

(Haha thinkin about this makes me smile)

(Eh)

(Hahaha)

(We did good)

(We did haha)

(Aw)

(In our own funny rushed kinda way haha
Aw boy

Might've done the trick a lil bit
I wanted to get as much of you as possible
Yeah I would've never guessed long distance)

(Hahaha that deadline)

(She thought I was visiting you and got jealous)

(I miss her dammit)

(Awwww)

(Don't tell her I'm relaying the conversation)

(Yeah that is someone I really wish was closer)

(Honeslty)

(And she wanted to know when I was gonna see you again)

(She probably knows
Like of all people

(But of all people she keeps me the most grounded and together)

(Agh)

(Just)

(When someone knows you still well)

(Mmm)

(Stupid boy
I realized I loved you when I realized you did that for me too
You are my two
My ride or dies
I don't know
That's kinda what love is for me I guess
Someone knowing you that well
And always keeping you in their heart
And it always being the same with them if it's one week or one year
And always feeling safe when you talk to them because you know that they're honest and they're smart and they know you
Idk
Now I really wanna call Natalie 
But I can't rn cuz she won't trust you anymore
Mmpf
Wow I have a short list
Guess I don't give y heart away that easily
Awwww
I'm getting all weird now 
I miss you so much)

(Yeah call her soon idk
But don't give me up haha
Don't ruin the trust haha)

(Tomorrow)

(Mm)

(I know
I like that you guys have that actually
She doesn't always make the best relationship choices
But she's got sense
And she won't pull shit with me
And she'll do dumb shit with me 🙄😂
Mmpf)

(Aw baby)

(I know)

(You two are good)

(It feels good getting soemthing right so young)

(I love you)

(Maybe I got everything right back then
Haha
I fought so hard to be her friend
So so hard
And I fought so hard to be with you
Maybe when it comes down to it I'm not lazy with people
Just picky
Cuz I seem to know who I really need in my life)

(Alright baby
But I'm gonna send you off to bed now
Good night)

(I do new dit)

(Goodnight girl)

(Woah

I'm full of love and nostalgia right now it's so weird
But goodnight baby)

(Awww I miss you being up for me)

(Hmm?)

(That was before I realized you were awake)

(Is me being up?)

(Usually it's the best part of waking up early
God the physics teachers want to make everything so hard here)

(Is that normal haha)

(Yeah cuz usually you're not asleep yet)

(Aw baby)

(Ryan the dream was so emotionally draining
Thinking about it makes me wanna cry damn)

(If not now
Tell me about it
Then later)

(Mmm maybe I'll get part of it out now)

(Mmphf)

(I never know how much he's watching me
And if he likes me or not
Cuz I always get stupid things marked off my quiz 🙄 but I already know this 
Mmmrrrrrggg
Then again e might not be the one grading these
Okay so we were sleeping together 
And I work up
And you were doing it with someone else in the bed
And doing the stuff I usually ask for
Also this was in the bunk bed that used to be in Audrey's room that was my room for all of childhood
And then I realized you were with my mom 
And I freaked out
And panicked
And I didn't know what to do
And you were trying to defend yourself saying it was unrealistic to only be with one person 
Because sometimes you want different things
And I had like this meltdown 
And I had to tell my dad 
Holy crap it was so weird
And they split up and all that
And eventually I took you back but I think it happened again
And then soem one told me that's what I got for ever forgiving you and staying with you
It was extremely stressful and freaky
And so so uncomfortable
Heyyyyy
Boyyyyyy)

(Hey girl
Just doing calc
Lemme read your dream
Holy crap
That's a weird dream
What it that?
Agh
So weird)

(See)

(Oh shoot)

(I was like
Super hurt
Like I was sad when I woke up
Like
So angry and confused and powerless
Audrey says thank you
Please never run off with my mom
But yeah that was it
Stop disappeareinggggggggg)

(I'm here
Sorry girl
I just had my phone silenced because my aunt was here)

(Aw that's okay)

(Your mom is freaky)

(I ain't running off with that 🙄

(I always get nervous you left it out. Somewhere and someone can see it haha)

(You're all mine hehe)

(Mmm you too)

(Haha)

(I've been thinking about butt stuff boy

They all have one easy solution)

(Now?)

(Now I'm scared of butt stuff)

￼￼
Mmkay
That satisfies it I think)

(I think so)

(Okay okay)

(The question wording was weird but I think so
It's a little weird to have a first degree polynomial so idk)

(I'm just gonna write that down for now)

(Does it tell you what's right?)

(And you get to teach me later 🤗)

(Cuz if it is I'll tech you haha)

I hope I don't have to spend too much on you when you visit
I'll help with food and stuff
But we need to split a lot of things sorry)

(Aw baby I know it's fine)

(No not yet)

(Don't worry boy
You never paid Europe?)

(I borrowed some cash
Because I suspected my investments would've gone up
So all in all, good choice
Because at the time I was at 10k)

(Borrowed from mom?)

(But yeah)

(Yeah baby)

(Life is exspensive)

(But it's okay)

(Mm hmm)

(People are lucrative)

(Yeah my dad wouldn't loan me money for that haha)

(Surprisingly
Awwww
That's sweet)

(My mom literally gave me 80% of her savings)

(Awww)

(So I owe her big time)

(Hey look)

(You still did a great job in stocks and she knows it that's all)

(Okay haha)

(If you're worried just pay off what you can
And leverage the rest boy
It's okay
Don't stress so much you're still just a freshman in college
You're ahead of the curve
Just stay there
Hey I'm sending you a pic of a painting here I like haha)

(Alright girl

(Okay just text me then)

(So if you do wanna work on anything now I actually might be able to

(Tonic water?)

(But I like it)

(That's just fizz)

(Kind of bitter)

(Yeah you mix it with him)

(It's fizz)

(Yeah)

(But a little bitter)

(They used to add malaria medicine to it)

(Mm)

(The drink was invented in panama 
You're welcome)

(Okay girl
Thank you)

(Just making sure I'm dating a well informed gentleman)

(Yeah this is the extra hard stuff too)

(But yeha people usually dig mikes

(It's 8%)

(Good for them)

(So two is more than three)

(Me)

(Just try one of each thing)

(It's gonna knock on my back)

(Yeahhh)

(And make me all wrinkly)

(And potbellied)

(Mmphf
Damn)

(Ngl I'm kinda happy I threw up most of dessert 🙄)

(Mm hmm)

(I hate that after feeling)

(I wish alcohol had less physical consequences)

(Agh
So tired)

(Hehe)

(I guess so)

(The physical consequences keep people and check
And let ou know if the people you're dealing with have an alcohol crutch or not)

(It's actually a very good societal tool)

(Hmm)

(Like
You know when you're talking to an alcoholic)

(Uh huh)

(And you usually know to kinda)

(How would define an alcoholic?)

(Read that situation)

(You)

(Someone who's physically addicted to the substance)

(Mm hm)

(Who's developed a dependency 
Like
Someone who goes trough withdrawals without it)

(But I feel like that develops a bit later on in life)

(Did you see my dad today?)

(So for younger people
Id gage it by how much they drank a week)

(Oh my god Mollie
But he was teaching me how to slide on the snow haha
Side note)

(His slide?)

(Like he was actually teaching me)

(Yeah haha
That was actually really cute)

(I did too jesus)

(Agh)

(I almost did twice)

(I thought he was gonna fall)

(But he kept doing it and laughing
It was nice to see him happy
He's been real down since grandpa passed)

(I think he's really happy you're there boy)

(But apparently it only works on the tire tracks)

(Oh yeah haha)

(They push it down)

(Because the snow has been compressed down)

(Yeah)

(Aw good boy)

(Yeah he's getting to 60 almost)

(I think when soemthing like that happens
They kinda remember that that'll be them one day
And they want to feel closer to the family they have
Holy crap)

(I forgot he was so old)

(It's crazy)

(I mean)

(Hey now)

(Let me rephrase that
Sorry
Older than my parents)

(Also old)

(Scott's dad is 65)

(Not like)

(Yeah haha)

(Grandpa old
But 
Ok nevermind
I'm making it worse
Big Ben is almost 60 too
And his kids are ounger than us)

(Oh my god yup
Aw
Hey did Kurnett just ignore us?)

(Agh idk I wanna go check that doc)

(Oof)

(Maybe the sharing thing didn't work
I really didn't think he would)

(Especially after I have him that letter and he came to see me in mech that day)

(Yeah I'd)

(Check the sharing
I figured you were gonna copy and paste it
That's way better than sharing a doc
For future reference)

(Thank you tech fairy)

(Mmphf)

(Here I'll check now
Agh
It says he has access)

(Sad times
Mollir

(Aw baby I'm here I'm sore I was getting something)

(Okay)

(Haha gin and tonic is the classic but it is a good mixer for sure
Bubbles get you drunk faster
And it's kinda like water so less dehydrated 
Maybe
Mmm

(Mmm)

(Yeah idk)

(I'm excited for you baby

(Like you've got three recommendations
She's good actually
Her arteries were at 90% blockage)

It depends on how early I establish myself and all)

(Don't worry about that now boy)

(But like post 30? Or sub 30)

(Idk I'm just wondering)

(Uhhh)

(Around 30?)

(Idk that's kinda the age you wanna have them for them to be all healthy and stuff typically)

(Hmmphf)

(Idk
I guess it depends boy
Don't worry about it
We got a head start already)

(Haha but yeah)

(I'd like to get one too
But that doesn't matter much
Well Mollie
Look at it this way,
If I get a job and you don't, your parents won't let you move up with me)

(I am very aware)

(But if you get one in Portland, you'll definitely be allowed to move up)

(I know I know)

(They'll even support you)

(That's why I'm pushing)

(So that's pretty crucial)

(We need to get you something
Don't worry
I'm sure something will happen soon

(To make friends and get involved)

(But it tanks your gpa)

(Now it's work
Mmkay
Yeah I get that)

(Toooo much partying
But yeah
I like mine
But you can get 80% of that and more from clubs
And it doesn't cost you a shit ton of money)

(I usually get free stuff at clubs)

(My two cents)

(Noted)

(Yeah idk sororities kinda freak me out)

(Yeahhhh)

(Stay the frick away from sororities Mollie
They're nasty
Also
Like $2000 a quarter here
Sooooo there's that)

(Frats are $400-600)

(Does that even make sense?
Woah)

(Yeahhh
No it doesn't)

(Wait what?!)

(The girls are paying for philanthropies though)

(What?!
Ohhh right
Wait hahah)

(Our thing is fundraiser)

(Honeslty a car way)

(The Sororities here grow fundraisers)

(Wash)

(Bikini car wash)

(Then they write a giant check with their own pool of money)

(Always wanted to do that for soemthing)

(Which makes it look like a lot)

(Cause if you have $6000/girl * 60 girls)

(Ryan let's have a swimsuit car wash)

(Thats 360k a year)

(Don't miss the flight)

(And I was getting all excited)

(What haha)

(I literally bragged to her 😂
Aw baby I'm so ready
Idk it's like a reflex)

(Why
Don't brag to them)

(Right right)

(That's not what you do 🙄)

(Like what'd you say?)

(Hehehe)

("I haven't had sex in 6 weeks")

(I don't see how that's bragging 🙄)

(I was starting that way but then I was talking about how I was pretty much satisfied all the time when we were together and we didn't use condoms and…basically I had a very adventurous attentive boyfriend)

(What haha)

(Sorry 
Haha)

(Awww
That's very flattering)

(Also she did a routine std checkup so I figure that'll have us both covered unless you've been picking stuff up 🙄😂)

(But tmi for the doctor)

(Nahhh
They ask like if you do anal and stuff)

(So that means I'm clean)

(Pretty much)

(Oooh nice)

(Anythig goes in the lady doctor)

(Haha)

(We haha)

(Ew haha
They asked about anal)

(Well we'll see when the results come back)

(Oh hey)

Cancer for me
Okay)

(The party is still one)

(?
Sooooo)

(On
Haha
Mollie, just saying)

(Aw baby)

(I really want to learn all my grandmother's dishes before she passes)

(I think that'd be great)

(So we're probably gonna do that 3-4 nights a week)

(We can go over there and cook with her)

(That'd be really fun I think)

(Hey)

(I learned all my family's 
It's fun)

(I'll bring my fancy camera
And we can take pictures)

(Awwww)

(And make a cookbook)

(Of ethnic tawainese and Chinese
Okay)

(That's actually very sweet
Okay
Love you boy)

Get ready for one of the best weeks of your life
Love you too baby
Because of Portland's gonna happen
And I'm saying one of
*because Portland's gonna happen)

(Hahaha)

(Uh)

(Yeah baby
Also good
I texted mom to call about the summer again just now
She said don't worry just call whenever you can go to bed now I don't mind
So like)

(No definite but not bad)

(So what's up?)

(That's all)

(As frick)

(That being said I'm brushing my teeth and hopefully sleeping boy
So do your thing and get ready for me)

(Aw frick
Would you mind doing it now?)

(￼)

(I kinda wanna know what's up before I go to bed)

(Idk now)

(If you don't want to, that's fine)

(Agh boy)

(Oh okay)

(Don't then
That's looks promising)

(I told her I have five min real quick so idk what she'll say)

(I'm just nervous)

(But yes
I know me too
Like
This is really keeping me going)

(I know boy)

(Sometimes she scares me)

(I'm never that sure why to expect)

(Okay baby)

(What
She said maybe just call tomorrow and maybe we can have Papa on the phone too to help lay things out)

(You do that
Goodnight anyways
Love you lots and lots
And for the life of you
Sleep on the plane
Grab some melatonin if you need to)

(Okay I'm gonna send her a basic outline so she can think)

(Okay)

(Papa did his beating around the bush thing with her which never sits well 🙄
But she's willing to discuss
So)

(Well I'll pray baby
Good luck)

(I sent this)

(Yeah that looks good)

(Ok I already started typing so I'll send you brief idea anyways. 

I have a four month summer. The first like month and a half I'll probably be home. Then I really want to go stay in Portland for awhile. I got free housing figured out and a job and I'd probably stay for maybe a month or two depending on how I feel. Then I'd be home for the last month or so of summer probably. This is all working around our already planned stuff like Hawaii. Papa said you guys obviously have reservations which I get, but I want you to know I've worked really hard to make this work out and I really really want this. Now that I've been out and about I couldn't handle spending my whole four months just at home, and I've got a great opportunity to do this now and cheaply and grow as an adult. Alright we'll talk later though, love you guys. Goodnight ❤️
Ignore the bad grammar)

(But push the fact that you got a job and I have three aunts who work at the hospital and might be able to get you some work too)

(I know boy)

(Because like that still might work)

(We talk tomorrow)

(Once you can interview there)

(I'll push)

(Otherwise, it looks like an excuse to live with me)

(Right)

(I know)

(Which I don't want it to be)

(They don't want me just shacking up with you)

(Yeah)

(I'll push boy
Good job
Okay I'm gonna try to sleep now)

(Sleep well)

(I love you)

(It's kinda an opportunity for both of us to work jobs and make a shit ton of money)

(So big)

(Alright baby)

(Big day tomorrow
Aw baby
I love you too
Don't worry
Just wait till you get here)

(Aw baby)

(Then I won't have to say it)

(You make me feel so good boy)

(I'll just show you how much I love you)

(Nighty night baby)

(Goodnight girl)

(She really really doesn't want me living with you)

(Huh)

(Wow)

(Not great)

(Well I guess that's off then)

(She said she'd call back in two hours and I hung up on them
Goddammit no)

(I am not living at home for four months I will kill myself)

(What?)

(I want this so freaking bad)

(They were just quiet for like a minute)

(You hung up?)

(Goddammit)

(Mollie)

(What's her problem)

(We can't win against your mom)

(She kept staying jt was abnormal)

(She's too stubborn)

(Like)

(That's bullshit what does that even mean)

(Logic's not gonna work)

(Goddammit she makes me so fucking mad)

(Yeah like I said)

(Just let me screw up and I'll come home if it goes bad Jesus Christ)

(It's irrationality that you're up against)

(I know where it stems from)

(You just have to break down where it stems from)

(Idk
And hit thay)

(What people think of her and probably come Catholicism)

(That)

(Plus like)

(Overbearing religion)

(She and a lot of ahit going on when she was little
Not a lot of structure)

(So she really really likes to make structure in her life)

(Yup)

(Goddammit)

(Well don't worry about it)

(Ryan
I'm just so sick of this)

(And show a detailed plan
On a google doc
I think what we need to do
Is create some structure)

(She said she'd call back in two hours)

(With financial goals and food, etc)

(Agh
Okay
I see that)

(Very very detailed
And thorough)

(But you have to realize that part of the scary thing for them is you)

(Kinda like a contract)

(So we can't be too codependent)

(We just come straight home)

(Okay okay)

(If we don't meet X income and end up just dicking around)

(Contract is a better idea maybe)

(Okay)

(X amount for college, etc)

(Because we literally can drive home whenever
Don't worry
When you show up, we'll make a plan)

(Okay boy)

(Until then, don't worry about it)

(Okay)

(It out)

(I'm gonna go run)

(Okay need to go back to studying)

(Alright boy)

(We'll figure out it girl)

(Tell me about it)

(Yeah baby haha)

(I realllyy need a run)

(Hey boy)

(Okay yeah)

(Uhhh
At some point I need you to open that package
I really don't know what's in it
Okay thanks

(Um)

(Shit)

(I won't get back until 7)

(I'll be in the air)

(Where are you?)

(Agh damn)

(Well then
Hmm
I guess I can run back)

(Mmm okay)

(I've got two hours between 12-2)

(Don't worry too much)

(Ohhh)

(Word are we can mail it to me I guess
Worst case)

(Yeah size wise
Uh
We'll just ship it
It's about 1.5ft by 1ft
Definitely not gonna fit on the plane
Um
It'll be like $15 don't worry)

(Mmkay. I just wanna know what they sent)

(Well)

(Hey mom texted
She says not to worry about this thing all day and that they want to call both of us tomorrow
Soooo
Hopeful)

(That's good
At least they're open to discussion)

(Also I don't have any stds)

(Hhhmpf)

(Please don't)

(And I gotta let my roommates know you're staying over haha
I speak from experience)

(You can tell them I'm a little sexually aggressive haha and I'll kick them out)

(Nooooo)

(Mollie)

(Yes yes okay)

(Porn messes stuff up)

(I did have this weird phase)

(Idk)

(I'm not gonna get off)

(What'd you do to fix your puss puss)

(Shaving or?

(So Motrin)

(Oh wow haha)

(Aw baby)

(Everything is for Portland baby)

I'm sending it now it's super long
Mollie, you have no idea how often you dance across my mind. I love you so much and want the world for you. I don’t need to walk on egg shells with you? Here are a few things Grandfather and I worked through during our long years being committed to each other. We moved from a small college to a large university because we were consuming each other. At the smaller school we were together so much that we isolated ourselves from other friends. We were living too much as a couple and, as we shared with you a few years ago, we didn’t want to become sexually intimate until we were 100% committed to each other in every way (marriage.) I know “times have changed” but God’s Word has not changed and we have attempted to allow it to discipline our lives. (I am not trying to sound pious. We know we fail a lot.) Your Grandfather and I have always wanted each other to be the best we can be, the strongest as individuals, each with our own interests and abilities which we bring to our relationship. Certainly you want to get the best from your experience at Northeastern. I  hope you are getting involved in some clubs and outside activities. I hope Ryan is doing the same. Your love for each other should grow you, not shrink you. Expanding yourself, exploring interests is a great deal what college is about. When I talk with your parents, I get different messages. Your Dad is so worried he’ll drive you away. Certainly your love and respect for both of them would never allow that to happen. I hope you are listening to both of them. Your relationship with Ryan must stand the test of time and distance. Please don’t shortchange yourself because he “needs you.” You are smart Mollie; wisdom is even more important.  With much love, Grandma   (I hope you will stay in dialogue with me about all this.)
Boy can I go help or soemthing

(Hahahahaha)

(Gaga
Haha
Goddam let's be professors)

(They do like)

(Dummmmmies)

(Nothing but talk about stuff they're experts in)

(They should just call in via google hangouts)

(Haha)

(Get free college for kids)

(Hmm?)

(And make six figures)

(Hell yeah)

(Master of none. Expert of nothing.)

(Jack of all trades)

(Master of mine)

(Eh idk)

(None
But better than a master of one)

(Hehehe)

(I feel like we need to boost up our credibility by become famous for some theorem first)

(Let's do it)

(Or we can work at Sierra college...?)

(Something really obscure
No)

(They don't have the benefits we seek)

(But it'd be close to home?)

(Mmmm)

(Mmm hmm)

(Close to grandparents)

(So we can be closely monitored by our parents while being in our 40s)

(Possibly helpful
Heheh
Right right)

(But also probably easy babysitters)

(Puurrrrfect)

(Butttttt)

(Mmphf)

(If we always sent kids to one and the other one knew
They would be salty as hell
Sooo 
Maybe not)

(Maybe we should just be transients haha)

(What's that?)

(Ooooh computer boy needs a vocab lesson)

(Shuttup)

(Take a guess baby)

(Cuz that's all I am to you)

(Or I will replace you with a Webster dictionary)

(A book with boobs)

(Uh transients)

(Sort of)

(No no)

(As above the mortal realm)

(Hahaha
Like
Vagabonds)

(But yes werre oinda the others too)

(Floating points of consciousnesses)

(Drifting through a vast space
That sometimes call life
Never touching the plane of existence
Ephemeral
Never knowing
Ghosts
What it's like
To get anally pounded)

(No no no)

(Because, we lack the bodies necessary to entertain such glorious notions)

(Hahha
Hehehe
Well you do
Hahaha

(Feces)

(Think about that)

(Talkin to noah)

(What're you up to?)

(I'm gonna call papa)

(Ohh
Okay)

(Noah is te mother figure I never had)

(Aw baby)

(So motherly
But seriously
If she doesn't allow you some autonomy, you're gonna get all depressed and/or crazy)

(I get that)

(Yeah don't do that)

(And I'm gonna say that
But I'm nt gonna tear our family apart over this)

(I don't think anyone wants that
Also)

(What?)

(I don't think that's even remotely possible)

(Tearing your family apart
Honestly
They're your family and they love you a lot
I'm just saying)

(Yeah I know)

(They're not gonna step off easily)

(Which they wouldn't ever say
Any threats are empty
Like if they say their gonna ditch you
It doesn't mean anything
Anywayssssss)

(Alright. Papa's gonna call after his meeting)

(Tell me how it goes)

(Hey hey)

(Same old as of now)

(Any luck on jobs though?)

(Haven't been too aggressive lately)

(Yeah it's okay baby)

(I need to talk to my family first)

(Talking to papa right now)

(Hey are you around? Or still busy?)

(It's actually pretty good)

(Okay)

(Mollie)

(Agh okay)

(Eh nvm  just keep doing  your thing)

(Papa still likes you for the record)

(Hah)

(Okay
I like him too a lot
Hey girl)

(Huh?)

(Can you just goto Portland without me)

(I'll stay in LA
But I still want you to go
Idk)

(Wait what boy)

(I'm just tired of all the fighting)

(Me too
That's what I'm telling him)

(I'm just gonna give up
Do whatever you want
I don't care)

(I know)

(I was just trying to do something good for us)

(God I'm crying so much)

(He says don't feel bad)

(Hey)

(He says he knows you were trying to do a good thing
He says you can always talk to him too
Ugh I love my dad so much
Alright well that's all over boy
Honeslty they still might want us to have soemthing 
I'm not really sure
He was just so happy to talk to me
He feels really bad about what he did)

(Can you break down everything they went over
Mollie hurry up go)

(It was just me and papa)

(So it's me that they're afraid of?)

(He just wants the best for me and he's afraid of me getting tied to anything too soon but he wants to give me space to live my life
He still likes you though
And he knows you had good intentions
Yeah kind of
But I don't think it's you specifically)

(What)

(Okay fine)

(We're done)

(With me?)

(I've never had a group so adamant on crushing my dreams)

(And I'm sick of it
And I'm not gonna do it anymore)

(So you're breaking up with me)

(But I really am on the edge)

(Oh god)

(Ryan)

(Okay maybe not)

(You do what's right for you)

(Mollie I want to so badly)

(I know baby)

(But I still really like you)

(I'm living it)

(But this shit is really fucking annoying)

(I know)

(Yeah)

(Hey)

(So I think I might just live my own self)

(You probably should)

(And not care about what you do)

(And then I might be happy)

(I'm so sorry Ryan)

(Maybe if I did leave girl...)

(Hypothetically
There would be no reason for you not to sleep around every weekend)

(Goddammit Ryan.)

(I'm like the only reason you haven't done that)

(Don't look for excuses to make this about something it's not)

(I do want you haha)

(I don't want this relationship to end but it's a two way street
I'm always going to love you
You've made my life so much better and I'm never going to be able to repay you for that
But if you don't want me anymore)

(I just don't want all this baggage
Anyways
I'm just saying)

(God I don't know)

(If you put on a small act for two weeks)

(I don't know how they'd even know)

(Or is that too mean?)

(Ugh Ryan)

(I'm crying so hard)

(Like "Ryan and I broke up but I'm so glad I'm attending a university where I can get my depression fucked out of me every Saturday")

(I miss you so much and I'm always so scared of losing you)

(Only on Saturday's is weak af)

(Then proceed to drunk text them occasionally on how much you miss me)

(I think it's too mean)

(Hehe)

(But I just made self aggressively clear with papa
That they need to lighten up some more)

(Because it's not just me it's you and me as long as we're dating)

(So Portland isn't over?)

(I don't know
If you went boy)

(I would visit)

(Fuck)

(And I would probably cry but I would visit)

(I give up)

(They'd at least let me do that)

(Yeah I want to be happy too)

(But it's real my heart to see something we built obeyed only get lives out by one
Loved
Lived 
Goddam
We're talking again soon
So maybe it isn't
But I don't know
Baby do whatever makes me happy
*you
Fuck
Just be happy
I really want that for you)

(And there are two outcomes
I'm going alone or I'm going with you)

(I know boy)

(Haha that came out wrong)

(It's not an ultimatum
I'm just saying that either I'm booking it as far as I can be from all you guys
But honestly)

(Wait what)

(I'm teetering on the edge)

(Or I'm gonna pick somewhere you, like Portland)

(At who everyone?)

(I'm really pissed off at everyone)

(I hate doing this
You and your family to be completely honesty
Honest
Like frick mollie
But I'm sure you could to
Too
I could avoid this mess by not picking you
I really like you
I like you a lot
So much it frickin hurts
Everyone's got baggage
But there are so many other normal families out there)

(Goddammit I know)

(With normal boundaries)

(I know)

(But this is a lot
And I'm getting real sick of it
I could've found a girl who'd go anywhere with me)

(I always thought I would)

(Yeah cmon do something about it)

(Fuck
Who am I
I don't even know
I'm so goddamn mad)

(Maybe I will tomorrow idk
I don't really care if they hate me or not at this point
Maybe I will end it because of this
Maybe you'll find someone they like)

(I won't)

(Mollie)

(Literally tell me everything you and your dad went over
Hey)

(Agh)

(I want to process everything)

(We didn't argue)

(Like everything)

(Every argument)

(It started)

(Every worry)

(Everything)

(He apologizing for being so confusing)

(Maybe they're argument is valid)

(Maybe I'll back off
But I don't know the whole story)

(He knew. He said he fucked up and he felt awful and he's been writing me letters ever since trying to apologize)

(*their)

(But he didn't want to call right away because he was all worked up and emotional)

(Because he obviously supported us)

(By supporting me then turning the tables like that)

(Like how did he mess up?)

(Did he miss a detail?
Did he not know the whole plan?)

(Pretty much he said he was afraid of me getting tied too tightly to anything at all right now)

(Or he did and he was okay with it)

(I think more the second)

(But changed his mind)

(I don't think he ever loved the plan but)

(Okay okay fair enough)

(When I initially asked I think I caught him off guard
And his knee jerk response was love a people pleaser
Was o be)

(I think more than that)

(So far the worry is being too tired up with me)

(He said he didn't even want me to choose a career at this point)

(Fine I can understand that)

(Just)

(Okay what next)

(To do what I liked and not let anyone or anything bias it)

(Wtf)

(No but like)

(Okay that makes it even easier)

(I think they want freedom for me)

(Yeah exactly)

(Aw that does feel kinda nice to ear)

(I don't care if you go into medical or not)

(Hear)

(Yeah girl)

(No okay)

(Wtf this is fucking freedom)

(A different kind)

(I only supported that because it sounded like you wanted that)

(I'm honeslty a little floatin in the wind boy)

(But maybe only your mom wants that idk)

(But I think I kinda do)

(Anyways)

(If that's what they want)

(Like meet other guys?
It makes sense
I'm just so fucking confused right now)

(I don't think he initially thought that Portland would be something that like. Idk set us in stone)

(I don't care)

(No like)

(But just fucking say it)

(They don't want me to feel like I have to be with anyone in particular)

(You don't fucking have to)

(And I'm thinking the fear is that
If we lived together in Portland at least, it's feel like marriage, and we'd feel like we had to be forever)

(But whatever)

(I think like that)

(Mollie if you don't want this I'll stop)

(No)

(I'm happy just to hear from you I guess)

(Okay if anything)

(If we lived together in Portland)

(Ngl I kinda thought that too)

(The chances of a breakup are wayyyy higher)

(Cuz)

(When you live with someone)

(I know)

(You eat tired of shit rellllll fast)

(Yeah I know)

(It is haha)

(Yes yes I know)

(Well)

(Like how messy you are 🙄)

(I texted papa
I think he might talk to you
And you
Hey
Yeah haha
But yeah)

(Anyways)

(Earlier he wanted to talk to you so there were no hard feelings)

(Fuck hard feelings)

(But I told them they needed to be more lenient and if he was going to talk to you better sooner than later because I wasn't sure what you were gonna do)

(Yeha I know boy)

(I'm pissed and that's all I want)

(Ugh I want to run again)

(Like if they push me to the edge)

(God I know)

(I'm gonna do something drastic)

(I swear)

(Don't get yourself in real trouble)

(Maybe they want me to break up with you)

(So you won't be tied down
I'll fucking donit
Do it
Just to spite them)

(That sounds awful)

(I'll be sad)

(You'll be sad
We'll find other people
And make them deal with that shit)

(Baby)

(I'll be fine)

(I'm so sorry)

(Uh sooooooo)

(I live you so much
And I always will
Just know that okay?
You changed my life
And I'll never stop loving you for it
And you'll always be in my heart)

(Yeah)

(Are you around?)

(Couldn't work
Can't sleep
What's up)

(Yeah idk
Just felt like checking up on you)

(Gutted)

(How are you feeling?)

(Idk
It might still work out)

(Or we might split)

(Uh)

(And my goddam lip hurts so much
I don't even know)

(Sorry about the lip girl)

(I'm just so scared)

(Yeah girl)

(That last day we were together I couldn't stop thinking
That maybe I wouldn't see you again
And I watched you walk all the way back outside and I cried
All I have is one life Ryan
And I just want so badly not to screw it up)

(It's okay
Just fuck your parents okay
I know they want the best for you
But Jesus Christ)

(I dot know)

(Why can't they let you find out what you want and don't want yourself)

(They still might)

(Wait wait)

(It's consuming me
Look
I'm just
Idk gonna lay here and cry it out some more
And think about thsi tomorrow I guess)

(Okay one last thing
Also sorry)

(It's okay)

(I don't know why didn't discuss this over text)

(I'm in bed anyways)

(Voice)

(I should've just called haha
I still can if you want
Okay okay)

(I don't know)

(But you said there's still a chance?)

(I hope so)

(I don't know if it'd be what we discussed)

(Honestly Mollie, there's nothing more convincing than hard work)

(I don't know)

(I know)

(If we prove to them that this is what we really want)

(Maybe boy)

(He was feeling really guilt about the work)

(That'll give us so much leeway)

(I know)

(If you get yourself 3-4 job opportunities)

(And I lock down my stuff
Okay girl)

(But let's just talk tomorrow)

(I'm gonna get three jobs by April 1st)

(I just
Need some quiet in my head
Okay baby)

(And if you can't come to Portland
I might just end it at that point)

(Just take them)

(I don't even know)

(God)

(I know)

(I'm really feeling powerless)

(Okay boy)

(Yeah and I still have your crappy earbuds hahahahaha)

(Crappy too
Haha)

(How are mine working out?)

(You have to twist them a certain way)

(Heyyyy)

(Eh)

(Haha yeah)

(What)

(Yeahhhhh)

(At least mine worked on both sides)

(Sorry)

(Yours drive me crazy)

(Lucky us)

My mouth doesn't move right haha
Agh)

(It's okay he told me he was probably gonna reach out to you)

(Mollie)

(Why)

(He said he wanted to talk to you)

(￼)

(Sorry I really don't feel good rn it's hard to think 
Okay)

(Okay I sent that
Anyways)

(I did not sleep then I did a little and missed my classes)

Sorry I haven't talked to you much I'm just really really anxious
Also papa responded to say he didn't want to be pushy but he cares about you I guess)

(Listen to this song btw

It's very soothing
Cmon listen to it)

(Mm okay boy)

(It'll make you happier)

(Ooh I like this)

I pretty much just told him that I couldn't stay with them
So
Idk)

(Yeah idk)

(I'm actually really really proud of you)

(I just told him)

(I mean)

(I'm so impressed tbh)

(Something has to change)

(Agh)

(And it isn't the same anymore
And I just need them to be ready for that
Idk I just wanted you to know
Aw good boy)

(Haha that's what papa told me actually)

(Mollie and I'm being so frickin productive rn)

(Good for you boy)

(I'm making some real badass shit rn)

(I'm actually kinda sick but)

(I just hole up)

(Ugh idk)

(Yeah idk)

(If I feel better I've got some good stuff)

(When I get frustrated or annoyed with people)

(Haha I've noticed)

(Yeah it's one of the better channels)

(I've been in my room for the past two days)

(Good for you boy)

(It's kinda good I guess
Yeahhhh
Well now I'm outside but still haven't said a word haha
I've said like 3-4 sentences)

(Aw baby)

(But so much progress holy shit)

(Yeah me too
Papa's gonna call now I think actually)

(Okay well)

(What's up?)

(That was a little weird
Well
I'm a little confused)

(But I guess I'm just gonna look some places that aren't Portland right now)

(Okay girl)

(And I guess I'm gonna talk with him again soon
Just
God
It sounds like their criteria is what I already had
And it's confusing
But I told him I wasn't going to be home this summer
At least not for that long)

(Your family is very confusing
I feel like they don't even know what they want
Which is proving difficult
I don't see why their priority isn't to have you be happy)

(Yeah I don't know)

(Yeah girl)

(I think it must be long term
I think that my parents probbaly have slightly different views
I don't know
I guess I'll just wait for papa to call back)

(I think that might be the issue
Your parents are different people)

(I'd imagine that's probbaly pretty common)

(Aww that made me smile too)

(It just sucks sometimes
Made me smile

(Mmm yum)

(It's so funny)

(What am I even going to talk about?)

(I really don't know
I don't know what he wants to talk about)

(Like maybe if he wants to explain himself?)

(Nope)

(Maybe just text him and say you've been busy and it's not that important unless he has something he really wants to call about?
Has he texted you?
Then maybe he forgot 
Ah)

(Mayve he still will)

(I said I'd let him know today)

(Hahaha you never do)

(But I didn't think I'd be asleep until 4:30 haha)

(Crazy boy)

(Uh)

(I'll do it for that)

(Maybe you'll be a bit more calm)

(Yeah)

Are you on the phone?)

(All done)

(That fast?)

(Yeah fuck all of you guys)

(Wait)

(I'm so sick of this)

(What happened)

(Baby what happened)

(Just nothing)

(A lot of silence
And questions with no answers
Just nothing)

(What)

(Nothing)

(Wait so nothing)

(Nothing)

(What questions?)

(I said my stuff)

(So he just didn't talk?
And neither did you?)

(And I didn't see anything wrong with it)

(Which ones?)

(Then he just said that they haven't decided yet)

(What stuff)

(But are at the same point)

(Decided what?)

(On what's best for you)

(What the fuck are thy deciding)

(I don't know)

(Wait)

(So Portland then?)

(But I'm sick with this)

(Is that a maybe?)

(I thought they'd be more open)

(They're so closed
He said how he was gonna let me talk and would be open to hearing
And nothing changed
It was like 8 minutes of garbage
I hate this
I'm done
Fuck)

(So it was the same as our talks)

(This is awful)

(?)

(Okay)

(Thanks baby)

(I'm talking to papa now
I'm done)

(I feel like a bitched out
But whatever)

(Like you bitched out?)

(Yup)

(Hey it's okay
That was a hard situation
But why did he say exactly about Portland and all that?
Just inconclusive?)

(Nope
No info whatsoever)

(Wait so)

(Just that they don't agree)

(Silence
That's so weird)

(It's all bullshit)

(He's never been just silent)

(I know)

(Wait they dot agree with us or each other?)

(He like didn't talk much)

(I don't know
I couldn't get anything useful
Like I gained nothing from that)

(Fuck)

(He said he wasn't going to argue)

(Something's gotta have him messed up)

(But if they can't put together a solid case)

(Yeha he hates that)

(But what does that mean?)

(I can't even trust them as rational people)

(Yeah like)

(Does that mean he's just gonna let it go?)

(I don't know)

(Yeah idk
I think love makes people irrational)

(I don't know)

(I'm bugging him now)

(Just try and fix this girl)

(Yeah boy)

(I want this resolved)

(I appreciate you trying)

(Because it's stupid and annoying)

(I know baby)

(Eh)

(Hey you did good)

(You're better)

(It's okay)

(I really want to unload)

(You went above the call of dut)

(Duty)

(But I don't want to hurt anyone)

(Doody
Hehe)

(Yeah yeah)

(Yeah)

(I know
It's okay
Let's not burn any bridges rn
Let me see what he's thinking)

(I feel like I burned that one)

(That bad?)

(So much silence)

(Cmon boy
It can't be that bad
I'm a good fixer)

(I'm sure I can handle it)

(So quiet)

(I think maybe he was trying to give you space)

(Eh okay)

(To talk 
But idk
I wasn't there
I told him nt to be mean or freak you out
So maybe that's what he was trying to do in a backwards way idk
But I'm trying to get ahold of him and I'll see
Ok he was just trying to listen
He felt like he's talked a lot in the past
He was trying to give you space)

(Should've talked more I guess)

(It's okay boy)

(But I wasn't making any progress)

(Whatever)

(I know baby)

(Are you on right now?)

(I am)

(Honestly)

(I think he might want a lil more respect or
Idk)

(The more they keep this up
The less I respect them
Sorry girl
But I'm getting real sick of not getting answers
And maybe that's my bad
I don't know
Just please fix this
They're your family)

(I am boy)

(Good)

(Alright I told him that I needed more concrete responses
So I'm pushing a little right now)

(Yesss
Good girl
More balls than me
But I really don't think I'm allowed to do that anyways
You have to be the pushy one)

(Yeah you're not)

(Just ask him to give you 3 solid reasons why you shouldn't)

(I know)

(And he can't use family values unless he tells us the family values)

(Alright tomorrow night or Tuesday)

(Wtf are the family values)

(Night)

(They call me)

(Okay haha)

(Have fun in that house with five girls)

(Mmm)

(Yeah well if you need backup I'm here)

(Alright well we're calling soon
Idk he sounds open rn
I'm not that sure what's gonna happen persay
But I'd say that whatever it is, we can be together)

(As long as you want that)

(Yeah haha)

(Haha
Aw baby
I'll take care of this boy)

(I don't mind talking if you're there too)

(You've gone above the call of duty don't worry)

(Yeah like in the bookstore)

(I know that
Awww
Haha yeah it does feel good to have support
But this ain't really your fight)

(I appreciate you baby)

(We had a solid two people)

(And you're gonna have to be berated by 2 people)

(Yeah it is kinda nice)

(2 versus 1 just sucks)

(Two people I know)

(And two people that love me unconditionally)

(Yeahhh)

(Which still sucks)

(But at least I can work it a little)

(Baby I want this so bad)

(Don't worry baby

(Aw baby)

(And it just manifests itself weird sometimes)

(Jesus Christ)

(Baby)

(Yeah
Ugh

(I'm so sorry
Aw
Agh I'm sorry)

(It's okay I mean)

(Does it really bother you?)

(You got it really young
And we thought I'd already been exposed
I'm a little bummed but it is what it is boy
I'm not really surprised)

(Not really)

(Aw baby)

(I'm just worried that I'll be one of those people who gets them a lot
And like
Ryan I am very sick rn
I mean
I've had a fever for like three days
I feel awful
It's just something else to think about I guess)

(But Mom says it'll get better with time)

Though Mom did offer to call in prescriptions for you if you get another one)

(Baby sure

(Pretty chill and happy people)

(Before he almost flunked out jaha)

(Mm)

(Hmmm

Something without a lot of stress)

(But still a lot of novelty and thinking)

(Hey are you still up?)

If that makes sense haha)

(I don't really want you to tell me that's it's different)

(Cmon)

(I just kinda like you being here
And being able to say this
So thanks)

(The way the world works isn't up to you)

(I'm still here)

(Baby
You don't get to choose how everything turns out
You get to choose how you react to it
And what you make of it
And you have to accept that if you wanna ever feel happy or satisfied with something
There is no "working out"
There's just working
But I get it baby
Trust me
I ate like four moon pies today lord knows that is not good for me
Go get gelato or do a sprint or jack off
Treat yourself a little
Let it all reset
Cmon baby

(Me too boy)

(Aw baby)

(Like every day)

(Fuck)

(Okay)

(So I don't know)

(I sort thought you might've been a little low)

(No not really)

(Do you wanna try and get some help?
Or just trying to stabilize yourself rn?)

(I'm fine
It just sucks)

(Yeah I figured)

(I'm okay)

(I know it does boy)

(But sometimes I just get sick of feeling like this)

(But like not great)

(Not how you wanna be)

(Eh idk)

(I know
And you feel crazy in your head like you wanna do soemthing insane just to shake yourself out of it
And change something
And escape
Fuck
Why does this always happen
What do I have to do
Maybe that's just how I get
Do you ever wish soemthing kinda terrible and crazy happened so that you'd have some sort of mission in life and like, not have I think about it
To
Shit I'm rambling
This is your thing
Come back
And we talk about you)

(Which part)

(All of it)

(I mean yeah that sounds good
But I just want to be fixed)

(How I feel?)

(What)

(I know
Sometimes I feel like that feeling is what makes me feel bad
But idk how else to feel that would make me want to improve ya know?
Like
Do we need a soul quest kinda thing?)

(Or an extreme sport?)

(Waiting?)

(Agh I don't know
I just hate feeling stagnant
And I hate waiting so much)

(Just)

(Yeah)

(Feeling like I'm waiting for life to really happen I guess
Idk
I feel like we moved from one school to another
And it's different but the same
Better but not)

(I want a calling)

(Haha meaning)

(Or a mission or
I don't know
Something that's mine)

(That gets me going)

(Good luck on that one)

(I know)

(Idk go make something)

(I know that's what gets me down
I think
I think that's why the daydreaming started when I was little idk
I think I might call Susan tomorrow
Maybe I should talk to her more
God boy
What do we do
I need something to hold onto to focus me)

(Fuck)

(Just take that ML course)

(Yeah maybe
I wish I could make more stuff like you
That I just need my computer and stuff for
Everything I know is like
Ugh
Not useful I feel like)

(Can I mak estuff with that?)

(You'll be very useful)

(Yeah baby)

(Mmm)

(More complex than anything I do now)

(And it's worth a lot of money)

(Huh really?)

(But you need to be on your math and stats game)

(Mmpf yeah)

(Yeah take that course and you can write image recognition software)

(Huh)

(Okay well design it)

(That could be fun)

(Maybe not write it)

(The programmers need these math and CS majors to tell them what to program)

(Maybe one day
Agh frick I picked the sore
Imma have to go wash my hands)

(Hahaha)

(Don't get me excited)

(Hahaha

I can never find ones that work for me)

(Mmmm)

(Haha)

(Like

Wear
They're calling in 45)

Too big?)

(Idk

Mmphf
Hey have you heard either of Courtney Barnett's new singles?

(Need a little time)

(I know baby
Hey when is it again the 10?)

(Yup)

(Okay imma tell Papa rn)

(And nameless faceless)

(The music videos are weird
But listen to them without the video)

(Hahaha)

(Oh hey)

(I never watch videos haha
Okay so no call then?
Just I be clear
Or if there's anything you really want me to include
Now is the time)

(Okay yes)

(Listening)

(Oh idk)

(Or yes that haha)

(Baby
I just really really want this
And everything they throw out there as an argument has been pointless so far
If they say something constructive, I'll listen
But I'm really vying for this
There's so much to gain as individuals from this)

(Right right I know)

(Work experience. Living in a badass city for two month)

(Papa said he didn't want to argue just talk)

(S)

(So)

(Going to the coast. Super close to Canada)

(Hahaha)

(Friends can can come up and crash for a week)

(It'd be so much fun)

(I know)

(And I don't see what you would gain for not doing this)

(Natalie wants us to go so bad haha)

(Other than being away from me
That's literally the only argument
Is not me
Haha yeah girl
Think how much we could grow)

(Yeah baby I know)

(We push each other so hard)

(And we do new things)

(Alright but theoretically if Portland fell through)

(And blindly sign up for concerts)

(And I brought up another city?)

(Uhhh)

(What would your feelings be)

(Well whatever)

(I'm still gonna hunt you down)

(Or maybe that's a later problem)

(I'm flexible)

(Yeha okay)

(I'll make that point)

(But Portland is wayyy cooler)

(So what's probably is gonna happen is)

(But we want Portland for family and housing and shot)

(They say no)

(Yeah)

(I say fuck it. I'm staying in LA or SF with Kyle or whatever
Then I get to move around
And probably end up finding you for a month and a half
And they can't really find me and punish me or whatever
Because I'm not their kid and I can do whatever the fuck I want)

(Would you be home ever?)

(Hahaha)

(Just trying to figure out like)

(Yes of course baby)

(If I'm home I want you there to)

(I'm probably gonna do the RV trip for 2 weeks)

(Okay okay
Haha)

(But just don't stay home for over a month
Like it might be comfortable and relaxing)

(No I know)

(But there's so much to do this summer)

(It sucks)

(Like if I have a home base  in a metropolitan city)

(Life is awesome)

(I know boy)

(And you bet your ass I'll teach you how to skate in Portland)

(I'm there haha)

(It's very flat
 I knowww
I like being able to walk to famous monuments
And see hipster bookstores)

(Hahaha)

(And hear about people seeing famous people but not actually seeing them myself)

(Me too baby)

(Hahahaha)

(Mm)

(Loser
Haha
It's okay
Opposites attract)

(Must mean you're destined for greatness)

(How's Ben afleck doing?)

(Haha)

(Yeah idk)

(Mmm)

(I didn't say much to your dad last night
But if you need me to unload everything I said right there
I can do that)

(Apparently)

(Just tell me if you wanna add me)

(Huh?)

(And I can join)

(To the call?)

(Like a three way haha)

(Hahaha)

(Don't do it if you don't need me)

(But if you falter haha)

(I'll try to avoid that trust me)

(No problem bab)

(But thanks bab
Baby
Haha
Bab)

(Thanks for being supportive bab)

(Ahhhh)

(Backwards dad
Hahaha)

(Nope)

(Hahaha)

(I just wish the dreams weren't so bad)

(I know girl)

(Maybe I'll call Kenya
Or I'll ask Susan
Mmmm I should make camomile tea
That's what I'm gonna do
I love tea
Make room for your tea kettle
It'll change your life
You can just buy a container or instant coffee
And bam
You're awake
And it's dirt cheap
And always there)

(I've been drinking tea every day at the dining halls
Mmphf
Free hot water downstairs
Just have to walk
And milkkkk
Mmm
Milk and tea)

(You nasty boy)

(Shit)

(Mmpf
Maybe one day
They are extremely unhelpful 
Mom really really wants me home for four months
I made it clear I really didn't want to be home
Pretty much no matter what Portland is a no)

(Which is bullshit)

(That's the worst haha)

(But as long as I find a job somewhere else it's fine I guess)

(Home for 4 months)

(I know)

(Have fun with that)

(I'm not doing that)

(Wtf)

(She kept trying to tell me I could have nice weekend trips
Bullshit)

(I know)

(Literally no idea)

(Like I'm down for Austin)

(But I figured Portland would be good for everyone)

(Yeah me too)

Agh
